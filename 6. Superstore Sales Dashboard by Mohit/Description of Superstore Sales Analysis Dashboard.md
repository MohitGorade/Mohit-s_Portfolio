As a diligent data analyst job seeker, I bring to the table a proven track record in crafting insightful and impactful Superstore Sales Dashboards. Leveraging data from 2019 and 2020, I've demonstrated my proficiency in financial analysis by showcasing a 154k total profit on 1.5M in sales. My skills extend to segment analysis, regional insights, and customer behavior, revealing key contributors like the consumer and corporate segments, high-sales states such as California and New York, and preferred payment methods. The inclusion of a 15-day sales forecast using PowerBI underscores my predictive modeling capabilities. Eager to apply these skills in a dynamic data-driven role, I offer a strategic mindset and a knack for transforming raw data into actionable insights for business growth.
