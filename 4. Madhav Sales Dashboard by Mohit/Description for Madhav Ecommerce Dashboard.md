"In my recent data analysis project for Madhav's e-commerce, I developed a comprehensive dashboard that illuminated key insights into the business's performance in 2018. The dashboard revealed a total sales of $438,000 with a profit of $37,000, showcasing regional sales concentrations in Maharashtra, MP, UP, Delhi, and Rajasthan. Notable findings included the substantial contributions of Clothing and Electronic categories, identified seasonal profit fluctuations, top customer preferences, prevalent payment modes like UPI and COD, and the top-performing subcategories such as Printers, Bookcases, Sarees, Accessories, and Tables. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in translating raw data into actionable business intelligence, honing my skills in identifying trends and informing strategic decision-making for an e-commerce enterprise."
