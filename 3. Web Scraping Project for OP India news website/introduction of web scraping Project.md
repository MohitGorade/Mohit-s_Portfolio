This project involved leveraging Python for web scraping on the OpIndia news website. Employing BeautifulSoup and requests libraries, I systematically extracted structured data from the site, focusing on articles, publication dates, and relevant metadata. This web scraping initiative not only honed my skills in data collection and parsing but also provided a practical application of programming in the realm of news analysis. The acquired dataset serves as a foundation for future research, showcasing my ability to navigate and extract valuable insights from dynamic online content for informed data-driven analysis.
