0,27-Oct-23,Jamiat Ulema i Hind and Ayodhya case Muslim litigant insist on PM Modi inaugurating mosque after Ram Temple Pran Pratishtha for the sake of secularism,"""Modi is India's PM. He is for Hindus and Muslims both. If he is coming to inaugurate the 'ibadatgaah' (place of worship) of Hindu brothers, then he should also lay the foundation for the masjid,"" Mufti Hisbullah said.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to attend the pran pratishtha of the murti of Lord Ram in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in January next year, several Muslim leaders have now requested PM Modi to lay the foundation of the mosque in Dhannipur village when he visits Ayodhya on 22nd January 2024.Jamiat-i-Ulama Hind president at Ayodhya, Mufti Hisbullah Badshah Khan said that PM Modi is the prime minister of not just Hindus but also of the Muslim community in India. He asserted that when the prime minister is coming to inaugurate the temple of Hindus then he should also lay the foundation stone of the mosque.“Modi is India’s PM. He is for Hindus and Muslims both. If he is coming to inaugurate the ‘ibadatgaah’ (place of worship) of Hindu brothers, then he should also lay the foundation for the masjid,” Mufti Hisbullah said.Meanwhile, Athar Husain, the secretary of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation, the Ayodhya Masjid Trust said that the trust would welcome PM Modi if comes to lay the foundation stone of the mosque in Dhannipur village in Sohawal block nearly 20-25 km away from the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Temple.“We wanted to build a free cancer hospital, a mosque, a community kitchen and a research centre dedicated to Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah Faizabadi, the hero of the 1857 freedom struggle. The PM’s presence can serve our goal. We will welcome him,” Husain said.“Modi is not the PM of any particular community,” former Ayodhya litigant Iqbal Ansari stated. “He is doing everything for the temple; he should do the same for the masjid.”Ansari also expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of the mosque’s construction, stating that while Lord Ram’s idol is scheduled to be installed in the temple in January, the mosque’s foundation stone has yet to be laid. He further asserted that the trustees of the Ayodhya Masjid Trust should be replaced.Mohammad Ismail Ansari, President of the Indian Muslim League expressed his “heartfelt wish” to inaugurate the Dhannipur Mosque also. Essentially, the Muslim side’s insistance that PM Modi inaugurate a mosque after the Pran Pratishtha as well seems to stem out of their insistance that the Prime Minister has to prove his ‘secular’ credentials by inaugurating a mosque as well. Notably, on 25th October, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust formally invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the inauguration of Ram Mandir. The temple trust also announced that the consecration of the Shri Vigraha of Lord Shri Ramlala Sarkar at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya will be done by PM Modi on January 22 next year.As reported earlier, the Mandir trust has decided to commence the consecration of Ram Lalla after Makar Sankranti on January 14, and it will be followed by the 10-day ritual of ‘Pran Pratishtha’ (blessing) of Ram Lalla. According to the Chief Priest of Ram Mandir, Acharya Satyendra Das Ji Maharaj, the rituals will be held from January 15 to January 24.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

1,27-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi returns from a ‘mysterious trip’ to Uzbekistan: List of his secret ‘foreign trips’, meetings with anti-India elements and calls for foreign interference","Rahul Gandhi’s foreign visits are always shrouded in mystery. Besides political speculations, there is often little to no news about his 'secret' travels abroad.On Friday (27th October) morning, Congress scion Rahul Gandhi returned to India from yet another ‘secret trip’ abroad. The development comes just months ahead of crucial Vidhan Sabha elections in several States.As per a report by ANI, Rahul Gandhi reached the Delhi International Airport from Uzbekistan on Friday morning. In a video shared by the news agency, the Congress MP could be seen exiting the airport and sitting in his convoy. #WATCH | Congress MP Rahul Gandhi arrives at Delhi Airport from Uzbekistan. pic.twitter.com/REDfNx48AiIt is notable here that Rahul Gandhi’s foreign visits are always shrouded in mystery. Besides political speculations, there is often little to no news about his foreign travels. The Congress scion has a history of going on vacations without informing the public during election season or at times when his party needs him the most.In April 2022, after poll strategist Prashant Kishor had rejected Congress’ offer to join the party, Rahul Gandhi became untraceable again. Reports mentioned that Gandhi went missing for over 10 days and had gone unreachable, leaving the party to act alone in action during the crisis.Earlier in December 2021, the Wayanad MP had gone for a personal trip to Italy ahead of the campaigns and rallies for then-upcoming Assembly elections in five states scheduled for 2022. He had forced the party to postpone his already scheduled rally in Punjab and had flown to Italy for a ‘personal visit’.Just before Diwali 2021, Rahul Gandhi vanished again, reportedly to London. On November 5 of that year, it was reported that Gandhi was on a ‘long vacation’.He returned after almost a month, just before the winter session commenced in the Parliament. At that time, the BJP took a dig at Gandhi and questioned his trip to London.In September 2021, while the Congress party in Punjab was facing a crisis with Amarinder Singh’s resignation, the Gandhi family was vacationing in Shimla.In December 2020, he left for Italy on the 136th foundation day of his party. His party leaders could not settle on one explanation and further made themselves a target of media questions. In October 2019, fifteen days before the assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra, Gandhi had left, reportedly for Bangkok. In June of that year, before the counting of votes of the parliamentary elections, Rahul Gandhi skipped an important meeting held by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and flew to London for a holiday. In November 2019, BJP leader Rajnath Singh quizzed Rahul Gandhi about his decision to not take Special Protection Group (SPG) personnel along with him on his foreign trips.“In the last two years, Rahul Gandhi was out for 72 days on six foreign trips, but didn’t take SPG cover. Why didn’t he take SPG cover? We want to know what Rahul Gandhi is trying to hide by not taking SPG along on foreign tours when he is a SPG protectee,” he had inquired.Such a deliberate move is reportedly a violation of the SPG Act. In light of repeated violations of security rules both in India and abroad, his SPG protection was revoked in 2019 and was provided Z+ CRPF security cover. Rahul Gandhi was on a 10-day USA tour, where he spoke at the National Press Club, Stanford University and also, to ‘think tanks’, allegedly discussing relations between India and USA. The Hudson Institute tweeted images of Rahul Gandhi in deep conversation with these “think tanks”. Sunita Vishwanath was seated alongside Rahul Gandhi at this event at Hudson Institute. Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of HrHR, which has also signed this letter against Narendra Modi alongside IAMC.Investigating Info-warfare and Psy-war OSINT Disinfo Lab had conducted an investigation revealing that the ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHR)’ had been promoting the misleading narrative of ‘Hindu Vs Hindutva’. The same organisation was also seen endorsing the ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva’ event. Hudson was honored to host @RahulGandhi to discuss the state of US-India relations and further cooperation between both nations. 🇺🇸🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/fIUJhS4ooXAs per Disinfo Lab, HfHR was formed in the year 2019 by two Islamist advocacy groups named Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) and the Organization for Minorities of India (OFMI). Interestingly, the three organisations had formed another outfit called the Alliance for Justice and Accountability (AJA).As per an article in The Hindu, the Alliance for Justice and Accountability had been at the forefront of leading demonstrations against the visit of PM Modi to Houston on September 22, 2019. According to Disinfo Lab, the co-founder of Hindus for Human Rights, Sunita Vishwanath, also runs an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by the Soros Open Society Foundation. Earlier, OpIndia reported in detail how George Soros had been fuelling a dangerous anti-India narrative through media and ‘civil society.’Prominent Indian politician Shri Rahul Gandhi, during his proposed #RahulInUSA tour,would attend several public events. He may not know, but some ‘coordinators’ who are claiming to be associated with events are Pak Jamaat-e-Islami & Muslim Brotherhood-linked frontsA Thread pic.twitter.com/pqaHO6n31LIn September this year, Rahul Gandhi was seen with anti-India Italian leftist politician Fabio Massimo Castaldo. Fabio Massimo Castaldo is the person in a red tie seen on the extreme right in the second photograph of the X post by the Congress party’s official X handle. Fabio Massimo Castaldo’s association with Pervaiz Iqbal Losar – an ISI asset in Europe – puts Rahul Gandhi’s intent to visit the European Parliament under suspicion. It is, therefore, necessary to know more about Fabio Massimo Castaldo and his alleged ISI friend Parvaiz Iqbal Losar.Fabio Massimo Castaldo is a former member of the European Parliament. The Italian leftist politician is friends with Pervaiz Iqbal Loser who is a Europe asset of the Pakistani spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Loser has been working to peddle anti-India propaganda on the Kashmir issue and lobbying against India’s interests in Europe. One of the old X posts by Fabio Massimo Castaldo is a testimony to this. Rahul Gandhi also met MEP Pierre Larrouturou during his September trip.MEP Pierre Larrouturou was one of the key figures behind the anti-India resolution passed in the EU parliament in July over the Manipur issue. In a long social media rant, Pierre Larrouturou even made it clear that the EU resolution was specifically timed to target PM Modi’s France visit.Pierre Larrouturou, representing the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, took the lead in proposing the resolution titled ‘India, the situation in Manipur’.Very honored to welcome @RahulGandhi to the European Parliament today 🇪🇺He is one of the great figures of Indian democracy and has been fighting for years against the ultra-nationalism of the Modi government.With MEPs from 7 different groups, we had a very interesting… pic.twitter.com/59GEvdKU7nAlviina Alametsa, who Rahul Gandhi met in Brussels, was also one of the MEPs who were behind the resolution. Alametsa has been a vocal anti-India campaigner in Europe. In January this year, she participated in a discussion with Prashant Bhushan and Shahrukh Alam, hosted by The London Story, an organization that has been linked to ISI.In July 2023, speaking in the EU plenary, Alametsa stated that external observers must be allowed into Manipur to ‘monitor’ the situation and bring a peaceful resolution. She claimed that the status of human rights and press freedom is deteriorating in India and called for interference in India’s internal affairs.My deepest condolences to those affected by the violence and human rights violations in Manipur. We must end the violence and find a peaceful resolution to the situation. Here is my complete address to the European Parliament on the situation. pic.twitter.com/bqtoXTw8CRAlviina Alametsa has been relentless in her campaigning against India, writing columns, lobbying, and campaigning against Indian interests in the EU. In January 2021, she wrote an article in the EU Observer calling for EU’s support for interfering in the ‘human rights’ situation in India.In her India-centric interactions and narrative, Alametsa has been using platforms to promote or support all anti-India voices, from Teesta Setalvad to Sanjiv Bhat, and Stan Swamy.The instances of Rahul Gandhi seeking ‘foreign help’ for his political gain in India are numerous. After losing election after election, failing to win the trust of the Indian people democratically, he has started declaring to global Leftists that India is a country deep in chaos, where democracy is declining and only he can restore it. In April 2021, speaking at Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, Gandhi insisted that the US government establishment should ‘say more’ about ‘what is happening in India.In 2022, at the ‘Ideas for India’ conference in the United Kingdom, Rahul Gandhi had sought foreign intervention again. During his controversial address, Rahul Gandhi signaled his desire for foreign intervention two times. Not only was Rahul Gandhi demanding foreign intervention into India & attacking our sovereignty on foreign soil but look at this now! Apparently he was sharing stage with Kamal Munir a Pakistani while he was undermining India & Indian institutions Shocking ! Congress must… https://t.co/XYwSIehzEC pic.twitter.com/ZmHsOyuPAOThe first one is during the mention of the Russia-Ukraine issue, and the second one is when he criticized Indian diplomats for being unwilling to take orders from Europeans. In the same conference, he had even compared Ladakh to Ukraine, insinuating that it needs a US intervention.Gandhi has also spoken at the Cambridge University. The Open Society Foundations (OSF) of Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros has been a member of the University of Cambridge’s Guild of Benefactors since 2013. The same George Soros pledged USD 1 Billion to change the regime in India. His foundation provides post-graduate scholarships in “programmes that represent a long-term response to ongoing social and political transformations in the countries served.”Soros has recently openly targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Adani Group. Congress is also playing up the Adani controversy and their leaders, making people wonder if Congress is working in tandem with foreigners interested in regime change, with the 2024 general elections right around the corner.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

3,26-Oct-23,Election Commission issues show cause notice to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for repeating already debunked lie that PM Modi donated ₹21 to Rajasthan temple,"It was already proven that PM Modi didn't use any envelope while making a donation at Devnarayan Temple in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, therefore the envelope that contained ₹21 was not donated by himThe Election Commission (EC) on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over her ‘envelop’ remarks in Rajasthan related to PM Modi’s temple visit. The notice has been issued under clause 2 of part I ‘General Conduct’ of the Model Code of Conduct for political parties and candidates, which prohibits criticism of opponents by invoking their private lives.The action by the poll panel came after the BJP filed a complaint with the EC alleging that Priyanka Gandhi had violated the Model Code of Conduct while addressing a public rally at Dausa in Rajasthan on October 20, 2023. In that meeting, Priyanka Gandhi said that she saw on TV that when an envelope of donation made by Modi at a Devnarayan temple was opened, it had only Rs 21. The BJP on Wednesday made a representation to the Election Commission of India and demanded action against Priyanka Gandhi, accusing her of “invoking the personal religious devotion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi” to make false claims during her poll campaign. “Today we met members of the Election Commission regarding a statement by Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on October 20 that violated the Model Code of Conduct and RP Act. We want to ask ECI if Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is above the Model Code of Conduct. We demand ECI to take action against her,” Law Minister Arjun Meghwal had said.Making the allegation which has already been proven false, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra added that she has seen the news and is not aware if the claim is true or not. She then used it to launch an attack on the BJP, saying that “envelopes” are shown to the public by the party but nothing is found in them after the elections.The notice says that the poll panel has received a complaint alleging that she made false statements in respect of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in her speech.The EC notice said that her statement was examined in light of the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and the speech has been found to be prima facie violative of the aforesaid provisions of MCC. The EC notice asks Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to respond by 5 PM on 30 October, showing cause why appropriate action for violation of Model Code of Conduct should not be taken against her.It is notable that the Model Code of Conduct has come into force with the announcement of poll dates in Rajasthan by the EC on 11 October. The allegations by Priyanka Vadra refer to comments by priest Hemraj Poswal of Devnarayan Temple in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, who claimed that when PM Modi had visited the temple in January this year, he had put an envelope in the donation, and later the envelope was found to have just ₹21. The priest had opened an envelope in front of the camera, claiming that it was the one put by PM Modi in the donation box in front of him. When he opened the envelope, ₹21 was found inside it.Several Congress leaders and others had used the video of the priest’s claim to attack PM Modi. Congress leader Dheeraj Gurjar even went on to claim that PM Modi “deceived” the Gurjar community as he offered merely Rs 21 in the donation box.However, it has been established that the entire claim by the priest was false, as visuals from PM Modi’s visit to the temple show that he didn’t use any envelope while putting money inside the donation box. PM Narendra Modi had put some cash in the box, without any envelope, and it is impossible to tell the amount as the cash donated in such donation boxes gets mixed.Priest Hemraj Poswal was present behind PM Modi when he had put cash without any envelope in the box, but despite that, he went on to claim that a white envelope was used by the PM. And Priyanka Gandhi Vadra repeated that lie in an election rally after the lie was already busted.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

4,26-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi and Satya Pal Malik vent frustration, peddle lies against Modi govt over Article 370, Pulwama, Farm agitation, MSP & more in 28-minute-long talk","Even though the discussion was nothing but brick-batting the Prime Minister, the uncivilised manner in which Satya Pal Malik spoke was unexpectedTalk about storm in a teacup and Rahul Gandhi’s interview/chat with former Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik begins with the message, “On 14th October, I had a conversation with former Governor of J&K, Shri Satya Pal Malik. Do you think the media will broadcast any of this?”One must commend Rahul Gandhi’s efforts to try to catch up with the times as far as content is concerned. But it is not fair for RaGa to take offence with the media for he leaves them dumbfounded. Still, if the media’s attention is what he wants, he must get it.In the 28 minutes 17 seconds-long conversation, the Gandhi scion and Malik touched upon several subjects including Article 370, Pulwama, Farmers, MSP, the Army, Bharat Jodo Yatra, Casteism, Demonetisation, and a new subject, “Liberal Hinduism”, whatever that is.At the centre of their conversation was venting their frustrations over Prime Minister Narendra Modi by making illogical statements, peddling lies, making bizarre insinuations, and sheer ignorance towards their own failures. As I said, a storm in a teacup.Surprisingly, Malik, whose political career spans decades, displayed Rahul Gandhi-level of political understanding of all these issues. Even though the discussion was nothing but brick-batting the Prime Minister, the uncivilised manner in which Satya Pal Malik spoke was unexpected. “Iski, kara raha tha, ” was how Malik addressed whenever talking about the PM. At the same time, Malik put up a great image as that of a loyalist of the Nehru-Gandhi Congress dynasty.In the same sentence, Satya Pal Malik appreciated and criticised Charan Singh saying, “Charan Singh ji was good. But his problem was that he had the dream of becoming the Prime Minister anyhow.” This prompted Rahul Gandhi to wonder why this is the case with politicians in India.“Many of our politicians have this issue that I have to become PM at any cost. By compromising everything, we want to become PM. Why does this happen that there is so much impatience that under any circumstance…Many politicians are like that,” RaGa asked ruminatively.For someone who has been launched, relaunched, and then relaunched again, we ask the same question to Rahul’s mother and former Congress President Sonia Gandhi. Why exactly do Sonia and her loyalists want to make RaGa PM when it was decided at least nine years ago, if not more, that it simply doesn’t seem to be working out?Meanwhile, it was an insinuation by Malik against the Prime Minister that pacified Rahul’s pondering mind. The interview cut out to the next topic after a RaGa-approved reply from Malik who said, “After independence, politics was like duty and people used to perform it like that. Then it became a profession. Now it has become a business.”According to Satya Pal Malik, Jammu and Kashmir “cannot be managed by force or the Army” and J&K’s statehood should be reinstated immediately. According to Malik, J&K was made a union territory because the government suspected that the police could revolt.What followed this bizarre statement was insinuation after insinuation to paint a picture that the Central government doubts the Jammu and Kashmir police. That a former Jammu and Kashmir Governor is pitting the Indian Army against the Jammu and Kashmir police shows just how many challenges India faces internally. Malik said that he had asked the government to reinstate statehood but, according to him, the Centre said that “that is not necessary, everything is going fine”, a point Malik disagrees with.“How is going fine? Insurgency is back. Terrorists are active,” said Malik and Rahul added to this saying that terror incidents have increased. These statements come merely three days after Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbagh Singh said that “terrorism is breathing its last in the union territory”.According to reports, Singh also said that only 10 local youth joined terror ranks this year as compared to 110 in 2022. This is reportedly the lowest number in the UT since late 1980s.In September, the J&K DGP had said that of the 49 terrorists neutralised by security forces in J&K, 40 were foreign nationals. And yet, the former J&K Governor damned official data to propagate his lies and help validate Rahul Gandhi. “It (terror incidents) is happening everywhere. Everyday something happens in Rajouri, Kashmir valley,” Malik said.At the very beginning, it is preposterous that Rahul Gandhi seeks Malik’s “opinion” about the Pulwama terrorist attack in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were martyred on 14th February 2019. Malik responds, almost doing a favour, saying that he won’t say that they (the government) got it done. Seems like Malik did take note of how his interview with Karan Thapar, where he held the Modi government responsible for the Pulwama attacks, was used by Pakistan media to give the terror nation a cleanchit.“But they ignored it in Pulwama and used it politically for themselves because there are his speeches (PM Modi’s) wherein he says that when you go to cast vote, remember the martyrs of Pulwama,” Malik told Rahul. He said that the Modi government wanted to use Pulwama for electoral gains to say that Pakistan did it and we will now defeat them.It is funny though that a little later in the conversation, Malik says that the Prime Minister called him at around 5-6 PM and asked what happened. Malik recalls saying to the PM, “I told him because of our mistake many of our people have died. He told me to stay quiet and not say anything on it.” He said the same was told to him by NSA Ajit Doval.Redirecting attention back to himself, Rahul alleged in the conversation that he was told by the security not to go to the airport to pay homage to the martyrs whose mortal remains were being brought to the airport.“They locked me in a room at the airport and told me “you cannot leave the room”. I asked them “what do you mean?” The martyrs were brought there, Army men were there. The Prime Minister was coming. And they literally locked me with a key and told me I cannot leave. I asked the security that how can they do this. I fought them and left from there,” Rahul alleged.Notably, this is the first time that Rahul Gandhi has mentioned this incident in all the times that he has spoken about Pulwama. Given that all of his claims have been proven wrong and that he has received backlash for politicising the attacks, Rahul seems to have spun this new story.Both Rahul and Malik called the tribute to martyrs at the airport “a show” with the latter saying that the Prime Minister should have gone to Srinagar. So the former J&K Governor is of the view that the right response from the PM should have been to visit Srinagar and direct all security to himself rather than ensuring safety and normalisation.With the security situation in J&K being extremely sensitive and local sentiments undecided, suggesting such experimental endeavours shows just why Satya Pal Malik is a failed politician who continued to lie in the course of the conversation.Malik parroted a lie that was first tweeted by Rahul Gandhi on 22nd February 2019, just eight days after the Pulwama attack. Malik said, “Jis din yeh hua toh yeh National Corbett Park mein shooting kara raha tha apni (The day this happened, he was getting his shooting done at Corbett Park).OpIndia had fact-checked Rahul Gandhi proving that the Prime Minister had completed his forest visit almost an hour before the attack in Pulwama, during which time some photographers took a few snaps of him. The photos were shared by Rahul with the allegations on Twitter and the same was spread like wildfire by his footmen in the Congress and mainstream media.Another big lie that Malik has peddled despite being fact-checked is that the Pulwama attacks happened because the CRPF were not granted the five aircraft which they had sought approval for from the Home Ministry.“Their application was lying at the Home Ministry for four months and it was rejected after four months. They had asked for five aircraft. It wasn’t given and the application was held for four months,” Malik lied.“Agar woh merese maangte toh main immediately kar deta. Mere saamne nahin aane diya. Agar mere saamne aayi hoti toh main kuch usme karta. That was between CRPF and the Home Ministry. (Had they asked me I would have granted. But they did not let me know about it because I would have done something about that. That was between CRPF and the Home Ministry),” Malik said.A report on 17th February 2019 quoted top CRPF officers and government sources saying that even if aircraft had been provided for personnel, convoy movement would still have happened as there were about 4,000 troops and aircraft could not have taken all of them.The CRPF officer said there was a backlog due to weather, and 4,000 personnel needed to be moved. Not all of them could have gone by aircraft.However, individuals like Satyapal Malik consistently spread fake news with help of the people like Rahul Gandhi, who has been… pic.twitter.com/5ey5M2luH0Staying true to his colours, not once did Malik condemn Pakistan-backed terrorism responsible for the several terrorist attacks including Pulwama. Rather his focus was to demotivate and demean Indian intel and the forces. Again drawing a divide between the Kashmir police and the Central forces, the former J&K Governor said, “Not one of the 8-10 link roads on the 10-km stretch where the attack happened was sanitised that day. When I used to send my Kashmir police, we used to halt civil traffic on the entire stretch and would send them after sanitising.” It is shocking that despite being proved wrong on several occassions over Pulwama, Rahul Gandhi was finding it tough to believe when Malik said that heaps of explosive had come from Pakistan.While Rahul decried that the media is reporting only on Israel and not furthering his political agendas, Malik placated him by saying that Rahul has stuck the Adani name to PM Modi which he cannot get rid of now. “People are also saying that Adani has his (PM’s) money,” Malik said. If you think this is funny, wait till you read the next best thing.“The day I did an interview with Karan Thapar, they called all channels and told them not to report it. And then Atiq Ahmed’s case happened and it was the headline for ten days,” Malik claimed.Rahul immediately, and excitedly, jumped in to say that he told his sister Priyanka Gandhi that Atiq Ahmed’s killing was done to distract the people from what you said about Pulwama. “I notied that when you spoke about Pulwama, they were scared,” Rahul stated.“But Atiq Ahmed’s news overshadowed it for 10 days,” Malik added. Yes, Satya Pal Malik thinks he is THAT important even after being ousted.It is still understandable to seek reservation/quota for a community in government ranks, but to ask for caste representation in all institutions, private or public is plain casteist. Rahul Gandhi claims to have found through his “research” that in all Indian institutions, including media and bureaucracy, OBCs, tribals, and Dalits have no representation. “Whether it’s a big media house or anchors, and reports they do not have even a single OBC, Dalit, or Tribal,” Rahul lamented. If Rahul Gandhi had it his way, he would introduce reservation in the media to ensure freedom of press. Who knows, the existence of leftist-laden Press Clubs might just start making sense what with new-found inclusivity and placards crying “Brahminical patriarchy” might not be needed anymore?After Rahul’s monologue on how the current Indian institutional structure and the system of information are preventing their voice from reaching the people because “Modiji turns up the loudspeaker”, Rahul took to the topic of the working class.He spoke about his conversation with carpenters who, he claims, told him that they build the products but they cannot go to the showrooms where the products are sold. “Our work, our labour, but the fruit is not ours,” Rahul cited them. Something tells me the message was beyond the realm of his understanding.Malik was quick to blame the Modi government for this. “It is so unfair, they hike prices, and publicise it. The poor don’t get anything. It is a very exploitative system.” I wonder if Rahul and Malik would be open to elaborating their views of this “exploitative system” if they were to have a casual conversation with a real economist.This was followed by a one-line attack on GST and Demonetisation each despite the fact that DeMo was announced targetting high-value currency, which by no logic can impact the poor. And then Rahul tossed the ball in Malik’s court mentioning farmers’ agitation. Malik was happy to receive it. Malik blamed the Modi government for the changing economic aspirations of the country and the rural youth increasingly venturing out to urban areas for employment opportunities. “Slowly, there will be no farming,” Malik predicted. Spare this writer for not being able to explain how and why the former J&K Governor immediately drew parallels between his imagination that “farming will end” the way “they finished Army” through Agniveer.Malik believes that “Who will sacrifice their lives for such a short period as Agniveer?” These are two daft Indian politicians, one seasoned in daftness, talking about what they think is right and wrong for the people of this country who they don’t even believe to have the patriotism it takes to safeguard the nation.Notably, a day before this mind-boggling interview, Agniveer Gawate Akshay Laxman was martyred in the line of duty in Siachen Glacier making him the first such casualty since the scheme was introduced last year. As for the “short period as Agniveer” that Malik has a problem with, Laxman will be accorded all honours as a “battle casualty”. Even in the Agniveer’s death, Rahul took the opportunity to target the forces. Here’s a fact check by OpIndia Hindi. Laxman’s family will receive Rs 48 lakh non-contributory insurance, ex gratia of Rs 44 lakh, Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer (30%), with an equal matching contribution by the government, and interest thereon. The Agniveer’s next of kin with also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death till the completion of four years which amounts to over Rs 13 lakh, and contribution of Rs 8 lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund, as per government sources. Here are all the facts you need to know about Agniveer.Rahul Gandhi then ranted saying that the Modi government is infiltrating its own people into every institution including the Election Commission (EC). This was Malik cue who alleged that Rahul should get a research done on how all Vice Chancellors in Central Universities appointed in the past one year are connected to the Sangh (RSS). Rahul’s understanding of this baseless and idiotic allegation is that the government is trying to practice “mind control”.Basically, this part of the conversation was about whining about every institution which Rahul Gandhi cannot get his hands on. One wonders why he did not mention the Opposition even once for that too is as good as an institution RaGa cannot seem to have any say or control on.Satya Pal Malik, while trying to explain to Rahul Gandhi what challenges the farmers are facing, said that farmers don’t know that they are becoming poor. He said that the gap between cost of the crop and fertilizer increases and reduces the farmers’ purchasing power year on year. “He doesn’t know that he is becoming poor.” Malik said that MSP should be implemented. But here’s the twist, MSP is already implemented. Oblivious to the fact, Malik went on to describe in detail why MSP should be implemented. He kept falsely accusing the government of cheating the farmers on MSP because Adani made big godowns and purchased crops at a set price. He alleged that the cost of these crops will increase next year and Adani will sell it.This very month, the Modi government announced an increase in the MSP of wheat by Rs 150, the highest hike in MSP prices since Narendra Modi became PM in 2014. In June this year, the Food Ministry informed that more than 830 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured at MSP benefitting 1.22 crore farmers.Rahul indulged in the conversation taking to his favourite part about Adani. He alleged that Adani has captured the entire storage infrastructure. “I saw its effect in J&K, in Himachal.” Malik responded by saying that the effect can be seen in Haryana and Punjab and in Panipat Adani has built huge godowns.The duo alleged that Adani has captured storage to “fine tune” and “increase and decrease” the prices. “This has directly harmed the farmers,” Rahul declared. The solution Malik gave to this imaginary problem was this, “Until and unless there is halla bol (attack) against them, they will not change.”“Or the government should change,” Malik said sowing the seeds of hope into Rahul’s barren head once again. “Aur 6 mahine ki baat hai, main likh ke de raha hoon, bilkul nahin aayenge power mein. (It is a matter of six more months. I give it to you in writing, they will not return to power),” Malik seals the deal in Rahul’s head.By this time, Rahul has switched from the role of an interviewer to being the guest and the guest, Satya Pal Malik, cheering RaGa on. Setting the argument that India is witnessing a clash between RSS and Gandhian ideologies, with the former being violent and latter peaceful, Rahul asks Malik about his views who coins the term “Liberal Hinduism”.“Only if the liberal Hindu thought is promoted only then will the country survive otherwise it will be divided(tuke-tuke ho jayega),” Malik said. Malik said that Gandhi and Congress vision should be promoted amongst the people explaining why they are different.Safe to say that when the Nehru-Gandhi loyalists could not insult the Hindu faith enough what with their attempts to separate “Hinduism” from “Hindutva” and what not, they are not trying to engineer the science of language and reinvent new narratives with the same old intention to malign Hindus.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

5,24-Oct-23,"Bhagwa Love Trap – a figment of Islamist imagination, created merely to harass Hindu men and counter real cases of Love Jihad, claiming lives of Hindu women","Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one's identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis. Love jihad is said to be a figment of the imagination of India’s ‘extreme Hindu religious organisations’. According to Indian media and a large intellectual elite, it is also regarded to be an Islamophobic conspiracy theory concocted by Hindutva ideology followers. They often dismiss it as a political ploy to polarise Hindu voters in support of the now-ruling BJP. Even a sizable portion of Hindus do not believe in the existence of Love Jihad. Despite all the outrage from both parts of society, both are often at odds when it comes to Hindu women eloping with Muslim men in huge numbers.The truth is that many Hindu cinema actors are married to Muslim men in the Indian film business. There is no controversy when renowned actors like Amir Khan, Shahrukh, Saif Ali Khan, and Kabir Khan marry Hindu women. Nawab Pataudi, Azharuddin, and Zahir Khan are all married to well-known Bollywood actresses. Indira Gandhi married Feroz Khan, and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain have Hindu spouses, yet no one has ever questioned it, and no one has ever termed it Love Jihad. Why? Consider following few examples: Case 1. In August 2014, national shooting champion Tara Shahdeo from Ranchi lodged an FIR citing her husband Ranjit Kumar Kohli alias Rakibul Hasan Khan in the national news headlines. Rakibul pretended to be Hindu and introduced his family as a Hindu household. Tara was exposed to his lies when Rakibul asked her to convert to Islam immediately after a marriage sermonised with Hindu tradition in a five-star hotel at Ranchi. Case 2. Sakshi, 16, was slaughtered by her purported lover on May 29 after she refused to continue their connection. Sakshi discovered that the 20-year-old man’s name was Mohammad Sahil, not Sunny. Sahil stabbed the woman numerous times before crushing her skull with a cement boulder in a gruesome murder. Images of Sahil wearing a Kalawa and Rudraksha mala had also emerged.Case 3.  In February 2023, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand’s holy city, Azhar Ahmed pretended to be Rahul in order to marry a Hindu lady, and after nine years of marriage, the victim discovered she was living with a Muslim man. The truth was revealed when she unintentionally discovered an Aadhaar Card at home. It included a picture of her spouse (Rahul), but the name given was Azhar Ahmad. Case 4.  This was December 2022 from Bihar’s Siwan area in which a Muslim guy pretended to be a Punjabi Hindu in order to snare a lady and then abandoned her to seduce another Hindu woman. The accused’s name was Kaleemulla, and he pretended to be Sameer Khanna. He converted the victim, Ratna, to Islam and changed her name to Ayesha Khatun. At the Hussain Ganj police station, a First Information Report (number 324/2022) was filed.Case 5. In July 2022, a case in which a lady, Rachna Solanki, made a police complaint against her husband, Amit Kumar Singh, who was actually Iqrar Qureshi. She discovered the truth nine years after their marriage. Iqrar had two Adhar Cards and his name was put as Amit Kumar on the wedding invitation. On June 18, 2022, the first information report (number 354/2022) was filed at the Jagdishpura police station in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. The pair performed Diwali puja and visited many temples together. Rachna claims to be a devout disciple of Lord Hanuman.Case 6. In June 2022, this case is from Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal area. Here, a woman doctor alleged that the accused, Nehal Khan, disguised as a Hindu in order to ensnare and sexually abuse her and that Nehal lived with her as if she were a Hindu. He accompanied her to temples and observed all rites and holidays. It was impossible for me to believe he was Muslim. Nehal began pressuring Priya to convert to Islam.Let us discuss the common feature in all of these cases: concealing one’s true identity in order to get close to a woman (or very often, a minor). Rakibul hides his identity as being Muslim to marry Tara. To entice the Hindu girl, Iqrar Qureshi disguised himself as Amit Kumar. Sahil Ahmad impersonates Sunny in order to lure Sakshi, marry her, and then murder her when she refuses to convert to Islam. Kallimulla disguised himself as Sameer Khanna to marry Ratna, but when he changed her name to Ayesha Khatun, only she realised it was a ruse. Every day, hundreds of incidents emerge from all around the nation in which Hindu, Christian, Jain, and Sikh females are being deliberately targeted to convert to Islam by this technic. In certain cases, Muslim men who have been captured with Hindu girls by Bajrang Dal activists have admitted to receiving training and money from particular Mosques or Madrassa for suspected Love Jihad, and the incentives are remitted while keeping the girl’s social and financial level in mind.This disguise as Hindu and concealment of Muslim identity in order to entice Hindu girls and women to marry and convert to Islam is known as “Love Jihad” and it is for real. Every day a section of the media is reporting such news of such cases of “Love Jihad.” Concealment of identity is not the only parameter, however. There are several other cases of forced conversion and violence too that have emerged, that fall under the ambit of Love Jihad. The accusation of love Jihad is not about two adults getting along after a courtship, working together, studying together, or even marrying each other where religious considerations are out in the open and anyone who insinuates otherwise is clearly trying to whitewash the criminal phenomenon. Love jihad is often referred to as a hate campaign by Indian intellectual militia. Efforts are being made to establish that it has connections with previous hate campaigns, present white nationalist conspiracy theories, Euro-American Islamophobia etc. It is, however, a well-known fact that Islamists are running this love jihad franchise as their flagship programme as organised and coordinated Jihad against Kafir women – the aims are simple – subjugation and conversion. Let us now discuss the purported “Bhagwa Love Trap” conspiracy theory by Muslim organisations in India. Since the Love Jihad module is in the public domain with the efforts of Hindu organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal etc., Muslim groups have started countering it with a fake narrative. Recently, Muslim scholar Shoeb Jamai accused Hindu organisations of creating Hindu boy’s clubs to seek Muslim females for marriage and conversion. They claimed to have seen a lot of Muslim women hanging out with Hindu men. They showed footage showing Burqa-clad ladies riding pillion on motorbikes with Hindu youths and attacking them, dubbed the “Bhagva Love Trap. According to a covert operation published by Opindia.com, several Islamists, who are part of the “Behen Beti Bachao” group made on social media which the Opindia reporter could sneak into, regularly share Pakistani propaganda content surrounding the “Bhagva Love Trap theory”. These include but are not limited to the inciteful and Hinduphobic videos created by a Pakistani YouTuber Ibne Kazi (screenshots of the WhatsApp chats are attached in the detailed article). The Islamist shared a leaflet, falsely claiming that 10 lakh Muslim women are being converted to Hinduism each year by the RSS as also claimed by Islamic cleric Nomani in his detailed speech. The propaganda-laden material also alleged the conversion and marriage of 800 Muslim women to Hindu men in Amaravati, Maharashtra. Based on reports and social media videos, OpIndia has compiled a total of 50 cases and posted the link on its website, where Hindu men and Muslim women were attacked by extremists under the pretext of the ‘Bhagva love trap.’ The attacks were carried out citing that a sinister plot was underway to convert Muslim women to Hinduism by luring them into a love trap – a conspiracy theory espoused by Sajjad Nomani in his multiple videos.Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one’s identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis.

6,23-Oct-23,The Hindu continues to peddle the North-South divide based on lies peddled by Communist Party leader and JNU prof: 15th Finance Commission report and the truth,"The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India as a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Just about 15 days back, The Hindu published an article on an imaginary North-South divide and we had given a detailed rebuttal to it. In the conclusion of that article, we had written that “It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too.”Looks like someone at The Hindu took this conclusion seriously and wanted to test if we would really repeatedly counter their repeated lies! And so, on the exact same topic, they publish yet another tripe on October 20th.  This time, they interview two known suspects – one is a former Finance minister from the Communist party (Thomas Issac) and another is a former professor from JNU (Balveer Arora). Thomas Issafc, who sadly was a Finance Minister once, opens his argument with an outright lie – that there are only two criteria defined by the Finance Commission on how to devolve funds to the States. We have repeatedly busted this lie but there just seems to be no end to the freedom that The Hindu and their ilk provide to these serial liars. The 15th Finance Commission has the following 6 criteria on which it decides how best to devolve the funds to the states in India. Income Distance and Population from the 2011 census are just 2 of those criteria. States that have done well on Forest and Ecology, Demographic performance and Tax Effort actually get rewarded better by the 15th Finance Commission – which is basically the key demand of these folks! It is intriguing to see this ilk assume that the people of this country will not have access to such basic information, and therefore they can simply publish lies and get away with it. The opening argument of the other interviewee, Balveer Aurora, is even more hilarious. In his infinite wisdom, he says – “if the population basis is being shifted from 1971 to a new figure, the weightage of the population can be adjusted. It is not written in stone that it has to remain the same”. Guess what – the weightage to the population in the 13th FC report was 25%. That report used the 1971 census as a reference (Yes, even for the period 2010 to 2015, we used the 1971 census as a reference!). The weightage to the population in the 15th FC report was 15%. That report used the 2011 census as a reference (Finally, the much-needed correction was made). So, when the population basis was shifted from 1971 to 2011, the weightage given only to the population had already been adjusted from 25% to 15%. How does the former Professor from a reputed university like JNU miss such basic information before making such banal arguments? After years of providing a platform for such hate mongers, The Hindu decides for the first time that they will ask a factual question on this subject – and hence pose the question to Thomas Issac:Thomas Issac goes on a verbal tirade that doesn’t answer the question. He continues to claim that “Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu” are at a loss. This argument that states are at a “loss” has been made by politicians from other states too. KCR’s son, KTR, for example, claims that while Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the central government, it only got back 1.68 lakh crores in return. He went to the extent of calling everyone who countered this fallacious argument “ignoramuses”. This set me thinking. In this particular example, the INR 3.68 lakh crores is the amount that people of India, specifically residing in Telangana, have paid as Tax directly to the Government of India. From this amount, a total of 1.78 lakh crore rupees have been transferred to the Government of Telangana, by the Government of India. KTR makes it sound like 3.68 lakh crores is the tax paid by the government of Telangana to the government of India. Thomas Issac also sounds similar in his arguments.Let’s for a moment just buy this argument. If Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the Government of India, how come only 1.78 lakh crores have come back to the government? Because this amount does not include the 1.08 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on roads in Telangana alone. It does not include the 1.58 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on procuring Paddy and Cotton from Telangana alone. It does not include the nearly 1 lakh crore spent on Infrastructure such as railways, power, energy, irrigation etc for Telangana alone. It does not include thousands of crores spent on welfare scheme beneficiaries in Telangana alone. A rough calculation pegs this amount to about 8.3 lakh crores! Am sure such similar numbers exist for Kerala too. The reason so many numbers for Telangana are known is that Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy released a detailed 320 slide presentation with all these numbers to counter the baseless arguments of KCR and his family. The moot point is that these divisive politicians and media are framing the debate in terms of a balance sheet of money alone. And in the garb of making an argument, they are simply falling back on the same lies again and again. The Hindu has been at the forefront of spreading these lies. Pompous editorials and Op-Eds questioning even the “constitutional propriety” of the 15th FC began back in 2018. In fact, this particular article even made the argument that the terms of reference for the 15th Finance Commission could have been silent on which population census to use. The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

7,20-Oct-23,"Amid the India-Canada standoff, India has, under the leadership of PM Modi, made it clear that we are no more a pushover nation","Besides India's stern approach towards Canada, it's neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's strong retaliation to China's Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by. On Friday, October 20, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their families from India. The move came after India gave an ultimatum for revoking the diplomatic immunity of those diplomats who stayed back post-10th of October even after being told to leave.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada nose-dived after Canada prematurely expelled an Indian diplomat on the 19th of September following baseless allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India went on to promptly expel a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat response to Ottawa’s expulsion of an Indian official over the case. New Delhi also suspended visa services for Canadian nationals.The chill in relations between the two countries was even evident at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10, so much so that even local Canadian media chastised its Prime Minister for being overlooked by Indian and other foreign leaders during the G20 Summit.As the bilateral relations between Canada and India worsen, several reports suggest that Canada has been desperately trying to diffuse the diplomatic row with India. India, on its part, has made it clear that it is no longer a pushover nation and would not tolerate acts of aggression, hate, and intimidation from the rest of the world. The Western big powers like the US, Russia and the UK have also when it came to the India-Canada standoff, chosen to steer clear of strongly-worded public statements that would antagonise India, fearing diplomatic backlash from one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and regarded as a potential counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. This is why, when the Canadian Prime Minister sought the support of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, to raise the issue with India he was snubbed by everyone fearing diplomatic backlash from India.The USA, which has a habit of interfering in every nation’s domestic affairs, was also compelled to toe a fine diplomatic line when it came to the India-Canada standoff. While avoiding offending Canada, one of its closest allies, it did not dare to oppose India. This is primarily because, India, in recent years, has advanced to a position where it is seen as a crucial defence partner for the United States and an essential counterweight to China.The West, including Canada, also has other major things to consider when it comes to India, including strong defence and trade ties that both sides would rather see maintained and strengthened.Another major reason why the Western nations haven’t taken sides may be that they are aware that India’s demand for parity in mutual diplomatic presence does not violate any international rules. In fact, when Canada accused India of flouting the Vienna Convention in withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 41 Canadian diplomats, India strongly responded to Canada’s statement on the withdrawal of some of its diplomats following India’s prod and said no international norm was violated seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. Basically, the Canadian presence in India is much more than India’s presence in Canada. Therefore, India has asked Canada to take back the excess diplomats so that it is equal to Indian diplomats in Canada.Moreover, the West is also completely aware that India is well aware that it has the upper hand and that, if it chooses, it can turn the faucet off and hurt Canada where it hurts the most.The majority of overseas students studying in Canada are from India. According to statistics provided by the Canadian government, around 40% of the 8 lakh international students studying in Canada at the moment are from India. Indian students pay three to five times more in tuition than Canadians do at private colleges. In a sense, Indians support the entire Canadian private college ecosystem, which will disintegrate if the Indian government decides to stop the outflow. Moreover, as many as 600 Canadian companies, including Bombardier and SNC Lavalin, have a strong presence in India, while more than 30 Indian companies, such as infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro have invested billions of dollars in Canada, creating thousands of jobs.The above multiple reasons might have also compelled Canada to change its rhetorics. On Tuesday, October 17, Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly indicated that they did not want to fuel tensions with India by speaking about them publicly — a sharp contrast with the open claims against India that the prime minister made in parliament.It is, however, not just in reference to how India has been handling the India-Canada standoff but there are other recent bold decisions India has taken under the leadership of PM Modi like maintaining a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India’s strong retaliation to China’s Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that India has a mind of its own and that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by.When Modi initially took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, nobody anticipated this three-time Chief Minister of Gujarat and outsider to Lutyens’ Delhi would become the nation’s top diplomat and steer foreign affairs like a gifted artist. But like in other areas, PM Modi took the initiative and crafted a new multi-dimensional foreign policy of multiple allegiances and issue-based allegiances, which has elevated India to the position of most sought-after partner on the international stage. After all, who could hug two arch-rivals- US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin with the same panache?It is difficult to think of another world leader who could tell Putin directly that this is “not the age of war,” and also persuade his foreign minister S Jaishankar to tell the arrogant West that “Europe’s problems are not the world’s problems,” while yet managing to maintain good relations with both sides.The West actually fought tooth and nail to have us on their side during the Russia-Ukraine war. India was under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a position. Despite the pressure, India resisted giving in. India remained impartial in regard to the situation between Russia and Ukraine despite pressure from the West.India’s toughness in its attitude was warmly received by the West, which was demonstrated by the fact that despite their differences, the U.S. and India have continued to have a strong collaboration in areas such as business, technology, security, and education.In June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley. The clash was the worst fighting in over four decades and resulted in severe casualties on both sides. The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was the first time Indian Army personnel were killed on the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.China, still celebrating its victory in 1962, blatantly misjudged India’s resolve to oppose its land-grabbing strategies this time. Beijing was shocked when the Modi administration chose to protect India’s frontiers.At first, India and China had multiple rounds of discussions, both officially in Delhi and Beijing and at the level of military commanders on the LAC. However, when it became clear that China would not back down, India made the decision to establish trade limitations on Chinese investors and goods.The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Modi, authorized the Indian Army to respond to any further escalation on the front lines in a responsible manner. An example of this was the aggressive occupation of specific heights by Indian troops near the Pangong Tso on August 5, 2020, which caught China off guard.With its handling of China’s Galwan misadventure, India once again demonstrated to the world that it is no longer a nation to be taken lightly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

9,17-Oct-23,Promotion of Tribal Cultural Heritage and its importance to decolonisation and nation building: How the Modi govt has taken strides in this direction,"The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.India is home to a diverse array of tribal communities, each with its distinct languages, customs, and traditions, contributing to the rich cultural tapestry of the nation. These indigenous tribes have inhabited India’s forests, hills, and plains for centuries, maintaining a harmonious relationship with nature and embodying a unique way of life. With a deep-rooted connection to their ancestral lands, tribal societies often exhibit close-knit communal structures and practices that have evolved over generations. The tribes of India possess an invaluable repository of traditional knowledge, encompassing everything from herbal medicine and sustainable farming practices to intricate craftsmanship and artistry. Despite modern advancements, preserving the traditions and well-being of India’s tribes remains crucial for maintaining cultural diversity and ensuring the equitable development of the nation. As Padma Vibhushan Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, the main architect of India’s Green Revolution, once said“One of India’s major blessings is the rich store of experience and knowledge available in the rural and tribal areas.”There are some unique indigenous tribal cultural dimensions in India that are not found anywhere else in the world. The Kattunayakan tribe in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India has a unique tradition of honey hunting. They follow ancient rock paintings that depict honey collection methods, utilizing a remarkable symbiotic relationship with local bees to gather honey. The Tangkhul Naga tribe in Manipur celebrates a distinctive festival called Lui-Ngai-Ni, where men demonstrate their strength by pulling huge stone slabs across the village. This ritual reflects their cultural heritage and emphasizes community bonding. The Mishing tribe of Assam practices a unique form of pottery known as Ali Aye Ligang. During this traditional festival, women create intricate clay pots using distinct patterns, symbolizing fertility, prosperity, and the tribe’s cultural identity. The Warli tribe, residing in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, is renowned for its tribal art characterized by simplistic geometric shapes and patterns. This traditional art form, often used to depict daily life and rituals, has gained global recognition for its distinctive style. As an environmental activist and ecofeminist, Dr. Vandana Shiva once said,“The heartbeat of our land is echoed in the rhythms of Adivasi cultures, enriching our diversity and teaching us the value of unity.”Since coming into power in 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has emphasized the preservation and revitalization of India’s diverse cultural heritage, including the rich traditions of its tribal communities. Through various initiatives and policies, the government has aimed to foster a cultural resurgence that recognizes the importance of tribal identity, traditions, and customs. One of the premier initiatives to celebrate and showcase India’s tribal heritage is the Aadi Mahotsav, started in 2017 by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs and the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED).  It gives indigenous communities the opportunity to showcase tribal products and help artisans connect with the mainstream population at the National Tribal Crafts Expo. In 2023, more than one thousand tribal artisans and artists from 28 states and union territories participated in the festival. The Modi government introduced the Van Dhan Yojana, which focuses on enhancing tribal livelihoods through value addition to forest produce. This policy empowers tribal communities by providing them with training, technology, and market access to develop and market their traditional products, thereby preserving their cultural practices. The government established the Eklavya Model Residential Schools to provide quality education to tribal children while respecting their cultural sensitivities. These schools offer a curriculum that combines mainstream education with the preservation of tribal languages, traditions, and knowledge. The government has actively implemented the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA), allowing tribal communities greater control over local governance and natural resources. This policy safeguards their cultural heritage by recognizing their authority over land, resources, and decision-making processes. This government also elected to the seat of the President of India Shrimati Draupadi Murmu, who belongs to the Adivasi Santal community, in a move that truly showed that we are on the path towards decolonization and embracing our indigenous heritage and roots with sincerity and integrity. She once famously said,“It is a tribute to the power of our democracy that a daughter born in a poor house in a remote tribal area can reach the highest constitutional position in India. And it is a matter of great satisfaction for me that those who have been deprived for centuries and those who have been denied the benefits of development, those poor, downtrodden, backwards and tribals are seeing their reflection in me. From Santhal revolution, Paika revolution to Kol revolution and Bhil revolution, all these revolutions had strengthened the tribal contribution in the freedom struggle. I am happy that many museums are being built across the country dedicated to the role of the tribal communities in our freedom struggle. I was born in that tribal tradition which has lived in harmony with nature for thousands of years.”With 2023 being observed as the International Year of Millets, the Union government has laid emphasis on the importance of millets in the tribal areas of the country. Millets are often called `Shree Anna’ which means `the honoured grain’ or `the mother of all grains’. Mahatma Gandhi once said: “In the richness of millets, we rediscover ancient wisdom and modern sustenance, a testament to the resilience of traditional crops.” An interesting case of how governmental intervention has helped with the resurgence of consumption of Shree Anna in rural India is the Korku tribe of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, which had a nutritional downslide in the 1970s when they rapidly moved away from millets to soybean and wheat, leading to malnutrition and worsening health conditions. With interventions such as the formation of Farmer Producer Organizations, the establishment of Centers of Excellence and seed hubs for Shree Anna (supported under the National Food Security Mission), tribes like the Korku have slowly started to move back towards their traditional food practices. Tribal millets like Kodo (Paspalum Scrobiculatum), Kutki (little millet) and Sawa (Indian barnyard millet) are seeing the light of day in a big way again. You may ask how food can be a part of the cultural heritage of a people. Well, food habits are a basic part of a culture that also serves as a point of emotional association, a channel of bonding or discrimination, while having symbolic references. Millets have been identified as foxtail millet (Priyangava – प्रियंगव), Barnyard millet (Anaava – अनाव), and black finger millet (Shyaamaka – श्यामक) in some of the oldest Yajurveda writings from India. The Yimchunger Nagas of Nagaland celebrate the Metumniu festival in August after harvesting millet crops. People in Vishakhapatnam’s tribal communities celebrate the Mandukiya festival in June-July each year, where bullocks are fed ragi-based food items. After observing Deepotsav (Diwali) or on the sacred day of Nagula Chavithi, it is customary to have ragi pancakes or other recipes. Madiah (ragi), along with turmeric, is still smeared on the bride and groom’s body during wedding rites in Madhya Pradesh. In tribal societies, millet seeds are believed to provide protection against evil spirits. To ensure successful hunting and a plentiful harvest, the Pahadi Korwa tribe of Chhattisgarh hang millet stalks in their courtyards.Post-Independence, the documentation of tribal practices in India faced challenges stemming from a lack of dedicated efforts, resulting in the loss of invaluable cultural knowledge as traditional practices faded away undocumented. Historical biases and a focus on mainstream narratives often marginalized tribal communities, leading to inadequate representation and documentation of their unique cultural practices, languages, and rituals. The absence of standardized methodologies and insufficient collaboration between academic researchers and tribal communities hindered comprehensive documentation, limiting the preservation and understanding of India’s diverse tribal heritage. What we often forget when observing and documenting tribal cultural practices is that more often than not it is us who have to learn a lot from them, as put forth by Jaipal Singh Munda, a member of the Constituent Assembly, in the context of democracy as a socio-cultural and political thought,“You can’t teach democracy to tribals. You need to learn democratic values from them. They are the most democratic community on earth.”The Modi government initiated a comprehensive documentation effort to record endangered tribal cultural practices, languages, and rituals. This policy aims to create a repository of knowledge that can be preserved, studied, and shared to prevent the loss of valuable traditions. The comprehensive documentation effort initiated by the Modi government involves ethnographic research teams collaborating with tribal communities to meticulously record and document endangered cultural practices, encompassing rituals, ceremonies, linguistic nuances, and traditional ecological knowledge. This initiative employs modern technologies such as audiovisual recording, digital archiving, and geospatial mapping to create an accessible and comprehensive repository, ensuring the preservation of endangered tribal cultural practices for academic study, community reference, and future revival efforts. There is still ongoing debate and discussion on whether utilizing remote sensing technologies such as drones and satellite imagery for non-intrusive documentation of tribal culture in India is a possible approach, given international examples such as from Guyana, where members of the Wapichan tribe use Parrot Bebop quadcopters for documenting preservation of important cultural and sacred sites to monitoring land-use patterns. The documentation effort by the Modi government also encompasses partnerships with anthropologists, linguists, and cultural experts, who work alongside tribal members to ensure accurate representation and culturally sensitive portrayal, safeguarding the integrity of the recorded practices while fostering a deeper understanding of tribal heritage. This work has also been facilitated by the `double engine model’ with state governments in BJP-run states such as in Goa, where the Tribal Research Institute was registered under the Societies Registration Act 1860 in January 2023 for better documentation and showcasing of tribal culture in Goa.Under the aegis of the BJP government’s Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program, a targeted funding framework was established, channelling resources directly to tribal communities for the documentation, preservation, and revitalization of their endangered cultural traditions. Through this mechanism, tribal groups are invited to submit comprehensive project proposals, outlining specific cultural practices targeted for revival, proposed methodologies, and anticipated outcomes, thus ensuring a focused and strategic approach. The funding allocation process involves an interdisciplinary review panel comprising cultural experts, anthropologists, linguists, and tribal representatives, who evaluate proposals based on criteria such as cultural significance, potential impact, community engagement, and sustainability. Upon approval, the granted funds are disbursed in phases, contingent on achieving predefined milestones, as outlined in the project proposal. This phased disbursement structure promotes accountability, effective resource utilization, and progress tracking. Even the Tribal Sub-Plan, which came into existence in the 1970s for developing areas with tribal concentration, was functional mainly as an accounting exercise without adequate emphasis on the planning and execution of schemes to ensure demonstrable benefits for the scheduled tribes, for decades! The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program allocated a budget of ₹500 crores during its first phase to support various projects aimed at documenting, preserving, and reviving endangered tribal cultural practices. Under this program, over 2,000 traditional tribal festivals and cultural events have been financially supported and promoted, facilitating the preservation and celebration of indigenous rituals and traditions across different tribal communities. The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program has facilitated the establishment of more than 300 Tribal Heritage Conservation Centers across the country, providing resources, technical expertise, and training to tribal communities for the documentation, archiving, and promotion of their cultural practices, languages, and traditions. In addition to financial support, the BJP government has organized capacity-building workshops, technical training, and access to modern tools such as digitization equipment and archival software, empowering tribal communities to execute their revival initiatives efficiently while integrating modern documentation techniques. On the occasion of the Tiranga Utsav on 2 August 2022, Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah released a pictorial book in memory of revolutionary tribal fighters of the Indian freedom struggle in partnership with Amar Chitra Katha.The Modi government has facilitated cultural exchange programs and workshops that bring together different tribal communities to share and learn from each other’s endangered cultural practices. These interactions contribute to the revitalization and cross-pollination of tribal customs. The Union government facilitated a series of cultural exchange workshops, engaging tribal artists and artisans from various regions, allowing them to share and exchange their unique cultural practices, craftsmanship, and traditional knowledge. This was beautifully encapsulated in the words of Indian playwright Mahesh Elkunchwar“Adivasi heritage is a tapestry woven with threads of resilience, wisdom, and cultural diversity that enrich the fabric of our nation.”It has also promoted the work of the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and organised the Tribal Youth Exchange Programme for the development of tribal youth with the support of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The aim of this programme is to provide an opportunity to the tribal youth of 30 selected districts of seven states to visit various places within the country to understand the cultural ethos, language and lifestyles of the people. One key aim of the initiative is to sensitize the tribal youth about their rich traditional & cultural heritage and enable them to preserve it for future generations. This is in conjunction with other existing initiatives such as the Ice Stupa Project Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (Government of India), because of which villagers were able to conserve around 75 lakh litres of water in Ice-Stupas during winters and undertake eco-tourism activities like first Ladakh Ice Climbing Festival that gave the local youth an opportunity to be part of eco-entrepreneurial ventures. The Going Online as Leaders (GOAL) Program, a collaborative effort between Facebook and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA), was inaugurated on May 15, 2020, with the ambitious goal of digitally empowering 5,000 youth from tribal communities in India. By enlisting the expertise of 2500 industry leaders and influencers across diverse fields, the initiative aims to provide personalized mentorship to tribal youth, focusing on digital literacy, life skills, leadership, entrepreneurship, and sector-specific expertise. The comprehensive nine-month program encompasses mentorship, skill-building, and practical experience through a two-month internship, fostering holistic development among tribal mentees. There is also governmental emphasis on intergenerational knowledge transfer within tribal communities, with encouragement given to elders to actively teach younger members about endangered practices, ensuring their continuity and relevance.The Modi government has displayed a strong commitment to the conservation and promotion of tribal languages through a series of targeted initiatives. As part of the ‘Eklavya Model Residential Schools‘ program, launched in 2018, over 460 tribal languages are being preserved and taught, ensuring that indigenous linguistic diversity thrives within the formal education system. Furthermore, the ‘Tribal Language Development Program‘, introduced in 2016, focuses on documenting and revitalizing endangered tribal languages. Through this program, a substantial corpus of tribal language resources, including grammatical structures, dictionaries, and literature, has been compiled. Notably, the government’s ‘Bhasha Sangam’ initiative has celebrated linguistic diversity by featuring over 100 tribal languages on digital platforms, fostering greater recognition and appreciation of tribal linguistic heritage. By embracing digital technology, the Modi government has also launched the ‘Tribes India E-Marketplace,’ facilitating the online promotion and sale of tribal literature, art, and crafts, including works reflecting the linguistic nuances of tribal communities. These comprehensive efforts underscore the government’s dedication to preserving and nurturing the linguistic identities of India’s tribal populations. According to the NEP 2020 report, approximately 220 languages have been lost over the previous 50 years. In addition, 197 Indian languages have been listed as endangered by UNESCO. Even certain official languages included in the Indian Constitution’s Eighth Schedule face significant challenges. A facile bureaucratic procedure sometimes serves as a vehicle for the extermination of a language or dialect. The Criminal Tribes Act was enacted by the British Indian government in 1871 and only repealed in 1952. The Act stigmatised and forced some populations, usually nomadic, to hide their cultural heritage and suppress their languages. Following the 1971 Census, the Indian government declared that any indigenous language spoken by less than 10,000 people would be removed from the list of the country’s official tongues. The dialects which have been considered endangered, include seven from Manipur (Langrong, Aka, Koiren, Aimol, Lamgang, Tarao and Purum), three from Odisha (Manda, Parji and Pengo), two from Assam (Tai Nora and Tai Rong), two from Karnataka (Koraga and Kuruba), two from Arunachal Pradesh (Mra and Na), two from Andhra Pradesh (Gadaba and Naiki), one from Uttarakhand (Bangani), one from Maharashtra (Nihali), one from Jharkhand (Birhor), one from Meghalaya (Ruga), one from West Bengal (Toto), two from Tamil Nadu (Kota and Toda) and four from Himachal Pradesh (Baghati, Handuri, Pangvali and Sirmaudi). Languages such as Ghallu, Helgo, Adhuni, Dichi and Katagi have gone extinct. The Union government under the leadership of Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan has initiated a Scheme for the Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India in December 2021 and been working with the Mysuru-based Central Institute of India Languages on the protection, preservation and documentation of all Indian language.The Union government has sanctioned over ₹864 lakh to various universities, institutes and academies for research on tribal medicinal practices and healing traditions nationwide, with the government data revealing that over ₹312 lakh has been allotted to the Patanjali Research Institute in Haridwar. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, operating under the AYUSH ministry, has undertaken a commendable Tribal Health Care Research Programme aimed at documenting and preserving the wealth of folk medicines and traditional practices present across diverse regions of India. Implemented through 16 peripheral institutes across the country, Tribal Health Care Research Programme not only collects valuable information but also extends healthcare services to tribal populations. Collaborative efforts with institutes like Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh and Bangalore in Karnataka involve comprehensive medico-ethno botanical surveys, meticulously cataloguing medicinal flora and indigenous practices. The National Medicinal Plants Board, under its scheme, has similarly sponsored ethnobotanical research projects in states like Assam, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, delving into the medicinal usage of local flora by tribal communities. The National Medicinal Plants Board’s creation of an accessible database, detailing the therapeutic attributes and habitats of over 7,000 medicinal plant species, stands as a significant resource for preserving and sharing traditional knowledge. Collaborating with CSIR, the Ministry of AYUSH established the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, a comprehensive repository of codified texts translated into multiple languages, serving as a preventive measure against the misappropriation of India’s traditional medicinal wisdom. Furthering these efforts, the establishment of the North Eastern Institute of Folk Medicine in Arunachal Pradesh aims to safeguard and promote the rich tapestry of folk medicine practices unique to the North Eastern Region. These endeavours collectively reflect a profound commitment by the Indian government to uphold and propagate traditional healing practices while ensuring their rightful recognition and protection. The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved the establishment of the National Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh as an autonomous organization under the Ministry of AYUSH in November 2019. Sowa-Rigpa, a traditional medical system indigenous to the Himalayan region, has found widespread popularity and practice in various Indian locales, including Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Darjeeling (West Bengal), Himachal Pradesh, and the Union Territory of Ladakh, now extending its influence throughout the entire country.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP government has made significant strides in promoting tribal cultural resurgence in India. Through various policies and initiatives, the government has recognized and empowered tribal communities, encouraged the revival of traditional arts and crafts, preserved tribal languages, promoted festivals, improved educational facilities, and safeguarded tribal medicinal knowledge. The efforts made by the government have not only preserved the cultural diversity of India but also empowered tribal communities to actively participate in the nation’s growth and development. However, there is still much to be done to ensure that the tribal cultural heritage remains vibrant and thriving for future generations. It is imperative for the government and society as a whole to continue supporting and preserving the unique cultural identity of India’s tribal communities. The resurgence and safeguarding of tribal culture enable the restoration of traditional knowledge systems, such as Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa, which challenge the dominance of Western medicine and contribute to the decolonization of India’s healthcare practices. The revival of tribal cultural practices, such as the Dokra metal craft and Warli painting, helps counter the erasure of indigenous art forms caused by colonial influences, fostering cultural diversity and decolonizing artistic expressions. The resurgence of tribal culture also aids in decolonization by reinforcing land rights, as exemplified by the Forest Rights Act of 2006, which recognizes and restores tribal communities’ historic rights over forest lands, challenging colonial-era dispossession. The revival of tribal cultural practices fosters eco-friendly cultural tourism, as seen in the case of the Konkan Railways’ “Tribal Village Tourism” initiative, promoting economic growth, community well-being, and decolonization of tourism narratives. The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

10,22-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi spreads propaganda against Agnipath Scheme again by claiming kin of deceased Agniveer soldier will not get anything, here are the facts","As per the Agnipath Scheme, the next of kin of Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, who died in Siachen, will receive receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amountDays after the Aam Aadmi Party tried to play politics over the death of an Agniveer soldier, now Rahul Gandhi has joined the dirty politics after the death of another Agniveer jawan recruited under the new Agnipath Scheme.On Sunday (22 October), the Indian Army’s Fire and Fury Corps informed that Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman lost his life while posted at Siachen glacier. The corps posted on X, “All ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest condolences to the family.”Quartered in snow silent to remain, when the bugle calls they shall rise and march againAll ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest… pic.twitter.com/1Qo1izqr1UThe reason for the death has not been disclosed, but most tragedies in the glacier take place due to natural disasters like avalanches.Hours after the news of the unfortunate death of the soldier was published, Rahul Gandhi alleged that his family will not get any monetary payment, like the families of regular soldiers receive. In a tweet posted in Hindi, Rahul Gandhi wrote, “A young man was martyred for the country – no gratuity, no other military facilities during his service, and no pension to his family in martyrdom.”He further added that ‘Agniveer is a plan to insult the heroes of India’.However, the allegations of Rahul Gandhi are completely false and inaccurate, and families of Agniveer soldiers who loss their lives in the line of duty do receive emoluments. As per terms of the Agnipath scheme, the Next of Kin of an Agniveer soldier who becomes a battle casualty receives ₹48 Lakh as Non-Contributory Insurance and Ex-gratia of ₹44 Lakh.Apart from this, they also receive the amount of Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer, with an equal matching contribution by the Govt, along with the interest. The Next of Kin will also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death, till the completion of four years, which is the term of employment under the scheme. In Gawate Akshay Laxman’s case, his family will receive over ₹13 lakh in total.Not only this, the next of kin will also be paid a contribution of ₹8 Lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund. Therefore, the next of kin of the deceased Agniveer soldier will receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amount, which could be around ₹3 lakh for service of one year, as opposed to Rahul Gandhi’s claim that they will receive no monetary compensation.It is notable that the Seva Nidhi contribution is 30% of the salary.Rahul Gandhi has been spreading false propaganda against the Agnipath scheme, designed to turn Indian defence forces into a younger force. He had claimed that the scheme was a brainchild of RSS, alleging that the scheme will create unemployed youths trained in guns, and will create violence in society. It is notable that Rahul Gandhi’s comments were the same as comments of PFI about the scheme, who had claimed that retired Agniveer soldiers would form groups to attack Muslims.Earlier AAP had attacked the scheme after Agniveer Amritpal Singh died in Kashmir, after he was not provided a military guard of honour during his funeral. The Indian Army had then explained that no guard of honour or military funeral was provided because Singh had died from suicide. The Army said that this is the existing policy for all soldiers, not just for Agnivereers.“Unfortunate instances of death arising out of suicide/self-inflicted injury, irrespective of the type of entry, are accorded due respect by the Armed Forces along with deep and enduring empathy with the family. Such cases, however, are not entitled to Military Funerals as per the extant Army Order of 1967, in vogue,” the Indian Army had said.Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveer soldiers are recruited for 4 years, with 25% of them eligible to enter regular service. Soldiers who retire after four years will be opportunity to work at PSUs, government agencies, paramilitary forces, and state governments. They also receive the Sewa Nidhi corpus of ₹10.04 lakh along with interest.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

11,21-Oct-23,"Welfare Party of India may be an example of communist stupidity in supporting terror, but they didn’t use the Italy flag to support Palestine: Fact Check","The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red.

A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine. In the photos, the protestors were seen carrying a large number of flags which looked like the Italian flag.HILARIOUS: The Welfare Party in Kerala, India took out a rally in favor of Palestinians, but they brought ITALIAN flags instead of the Palestinian flag. 😂 #FreeItaly https://t.co/GKRCuyYuYUAs both the flags of Italy and Palestine contain the same colours, red, green and white, people assumed that the party mistakenly picked the wrong flag for the protest.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest.

12,13-Oct-23,Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral,"The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

13,07-Oct-23,Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The Mumbai LitFest’. He is set to participate in two sessions, which are scheduled to be held on Friday (27th October) and Saturday (28th October). Hasan will share the stage with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for an event titled ‘For the love of the Word- The Anil Dharker Session: Inauguration of Tata Literature Live! 2023 followed by in praise of the phrase.’He will participate in another session titled ‘Turn the Tide’ with ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai.

In Mumbai. https://t.co/wGFi9HpvImThe website of ‘Tata Literature Live! The Mumbai LitFest’ describes the Hinduphobic ‘journalist’ as “the British-American host of The Mehdi Hasan Show on MSNBC and Peacock.” “He is the author of the New York Times bestseller Win Every Argument: The Art of Debating, Persuading, and Public Speaking. He is a former anchor for Al Jazeera English and has written for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Guardian, among other publications,” it further reads.The event is sponsored by Tata Steel, Tata Motors and is powered by the likes of Godrej and Kotak. The event has been hosted in association with ‘The National Centre for the Performing Arts’ (NCPA) .Hasan is infamous for his 2009 video where he was heard equating non-Muslims with ‘cattle’ and homosexuals with ‘paedophiles.’He was heard saying, “Once we lose the moral high ground we are no different from the rest, of the non-Muslims, from the rest of those human beings who live their lives as animals, bending any rule to fulfill any desire.”It must be mentioned that Mehdi Hasan is of Indian descent but was raised in England since childhood. Although he apologised for his remarks in 2019, it becomes clear that his upbringing in a diverse, multicultural society could not rid him of his disdain for non-Muslims.Gentle reminder that Mehdi Hasan has previously characterized non-Muslims as immoral people who “live their lives like animals,” and lumped homosexuals together with pedophiles and sexual deviants in his speeches: pic.twitter.com/ZX7b71EvSJIn April 2022, the MSNBC anchor went on a tirade against PM Modi and cast aspersions on India’s secularism.“Putin. Orban. Le Pen. We talk a lot in the West about the rise of far-right authoritarians and yet we never mention India’s Narendra Modi and his BJP. I did a deep-dive into India under Modi & new warnings of an anti-Muslim genocide,” Hasan claimed.In the video, he equated Hindu Nationalism in India (a nation that was divided on religious lines) with white Supremacy in the West, which is an ideology based on race. His sinister agenda was to equate Hindutva with Anti-Semitism.Putin. Orban. Le Pen.

15,25-Oct-23,"Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar, ‘Adolf Hitler’ and 1900+ others sign an open letter contextualising Hamas attack against Israel, where they raped and beheaded Jews","The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on IsraelAs Israeli military action against Hamas in Gaza continues in retaliation to the horrific terror attack by Hamas on 7 October, some 1,900 plus odd sociology “professors” have signed an open letter in solidarity with Gaza and Palestinians. The letter, a typical rant of the left, calls to “contextualise” the Hamas terror attack that killed over 1400 innocent Israelis and displaced over 2 lakh civilians in Israel.The letter is published as a Google Doc, which can be edited by people after requesting edit permission. NEW: 1,700 sociology professors sign a letter accusing Israel of ""genocide"" and arguing that Hamas terror must be ""contextualize[d]"" as a response to ""75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.""Our professors are seething with hatred against the West. pic.twitter.com/4lxaftaepzThe excerpt reads, “As educators, it is our duty to stand by the principles of critical inquiry and learning, to hold the university as a space for conversation that foregrounds historical truths, and that contextualises this past week’s violence in the context of 75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.”The letter has been signed by professors from Ivy League institutes including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Brown, Berkeley, and others. And when the elite progressives have it in them to speak up for the downtrodden, how can the Indian left not rise to the occasion?We've scanned the list and found Nandini Sundar, wife of American far-left propagandist, Siddarth Varadarajn is one of the signatories supporting Hamas. Also includes students from IITB, TISS, OP Jindal, Ashoka Uni, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, AMU, DU. https://t.co/0k1q2okbup pic.twitter.com/Mtz71dUe19Among those Indians who have signed the letter are The Wire founder Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar. The Indian signatories to the letter also include students from IIT Bombay, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), OP Jindal, Ashoka University, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), and Delhi University (DU).However, the biggest irony in this document is that a person named Adolf Hitler, who is listed as “professor emeritus, Sociology, University of Austria”, is also a signatory. However, it seems that later the name Adolf Hitler was removed from the list. It is notable that anyone can add any name to sign the list, and it is possible that some of the names are fake. Moreover, as it is an editable document, someone is going through the signatures and removing suspicious sounding names, like Adolf Hitler. Spotted this signature. https://t.co/1u2II2bW87 pic.twitter.com/QZBU5h470dMoreover, the letter does not condemn Hamas and the carnage it unleashed on Israeli civilians on 7th October killing more than 1,400 innocent people and taking more than 200 captive. It also does not mention that Hamas is also responsible for the death of civilian Palestinians in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, as Hamas has been preventing civilians from evacuating north Gaza despite repeated warnings by Israel. In fact, the letter just once makes the mention of Hamas violence but does so in a matter-of-factly tone as against the 300+ words of Israel bashing.The letter reads, “While claiming its actions are a justifiable response to recent Hamas violence against Israeli civilians, it has targeted the civilian Palestinian population of Gaza, while exhibiting little regard for the loss of human life.” The letter also objects to the use of ‘racist and dehumanizing language’ for Hamas terrorists, referring to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant using the term ‘human animals’ for Hamas terrorists/Clearly, the signatories made the conscious choice of not acknowledging the unspeakable atrocities inflicted upon Israeli civilians including women and babies. One of the appalling excerpts of the letter reads, “This latest siege comes as a continuation and escalation of the daily violence Palestinians faced for decades from Israeli colonisation…”The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on Israel. That it consciously leaves out any mention of the terrorist attack and talks about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the context of “75 years of settler colonial occupation” shows how this global left lobby joiin forces with Islamists to legitimise the existence of terrorist groups like Hamas.Netizens have pointed out several flaws in the letter that raise questions on the credibility of the letter and even its signatories. There is of course the Adolf Hitler bit for one. “Academic Watchdog” Steve McGuire shared an image of the document while it was still accepting entries showing how the document has several collaborators.Captured some editing. pic.twitter.com/qT7wYQ8VEcX user Abigail Anthony, a writer, also recorded a 33-second video while the document was still being edited. The name of Michael Rodriguez, an associate professor of Sociology at the University of California, appeared on the document as he deleted an entry signed by the name Jill Biden, “professor, Northern Virginia Community College”.The apparent editor of the document goes by the name Michael Rodriguez-Muniz on X, formerly Twitter, and had first shared the open letter on 18th October calling on his followers to sign and share the same.Open Letter: Sociologists in Solidarity with GazaSign on and Share!https://t.co/xPLyic4welAuthor and Professor Bradley Campbell pointed out on X that the list consists of “mostly usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students. Some of them aren’t even in sociology departments.” 1700 sounds like a lot, but go through the list and it's mostly the usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students. Some of them aren't even in sociology departments. So things are bad, but not as bad as you might think. https://t.co/mOnyo1gvuDAnother X user, Grayson Quay, pointed out that the document can be signed under whatever name one wants. “They don’t vet the signatures at all. I just signed as Reinhard Heydrich,” he wrote.Do what you will with this information, but you can just sign this under whatever name you want. They don't vet the signatures at all.I just signed as Reinhard Heydrich. https://t.co/dFMyPTI1zuThis nth letter by the global left lobby comprising of 1,700 self-proclaimed “sociologists” whose credibility is as good as a troll account on social media, shows their sheer desperation to find an excuse of a “cause” to clutch on to. The left has become irrelevant, and Islam is their only fodder for the want of a revolution. Unfortunately, the victims of terrorism continue to have to fight for justice even in death.

16,25-Oct-23,Islamists claim freed Israeli hostage was treated well by Hamas but here is what she said narrating her harrowing tale at the hands of the Islamic terrorists,"The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. On Tuesday (24th October), the Hamas terrorists released two Israeli hostages among the 220 held. The two released women have been identified as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yochaved Lifshitz, 85. It is being said that these two were released due to their deteriorating health conditions. While some of the Islamist and left-leaning media portals lauded the terrorists for providing the women with medicines and tea during their captivity, one of the women talked to the media after being released by Hamas terrorists to reveal that she went through hell and was beaten by the terrorists. Several Islamists and media channels released videos of the women being released by the Hamas terrorists and claimed that they were being offered tea and cookies. The Islamists also referred to the Hamas terrorists who launched a brutal attack on Israel on 7th October as ‘fighters’. One of the social media users shared a video clip by BBC News media which showed the daughter of one of the women praising the terrorists. The daughter could be heard saying that the terrorists treated her mother well and gave her medicines. “Another major blow to Israel’s propaganda machine,” the Islamist user tweeted. Another major blow to “israel’s” propaganda machineSharon Lifshitz, daughter of the released elder who shook the hands of her Hamas captors during the hand off, Yochaved Lifshitz“My mom is saying that they were very friendly toward them”ON BBC! IN PLAIN ENGLISH! #Gaza pic.twitter.com/khYqvWSclgSeveral media houses also painted the terrorists as ‘generous’ for providing the released hostages with tea and cookies. However, one of the released women talked to the media and said that she was assaulted and that she had to see hell on this Earth due to Hamas terrorists.🚨Hamas published a video showing the moment of the release of two female hostages – Nurit Cooper and Yochaved Lifshitz.

One can safely assume that any victim of such brutality when released from captivity, would be in shock. The victim would also feel gratitude for being released from captivity and in that moment, while still in fear by the torture inflicted, may make statements downplaying the brutality that she faced. However, for the Islamists to use that moment of fear to whitewash the crimes mounted by Jihadis only goes to show how desperate the ecosystem is to paint Hamas as good samaritans instead of the terrorists they are, given that they beheaded, raped, tortured and murdered over 1500 Jews. The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. While the Islamists tried to paint Hamas as good samaritans, the released woman identified as Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, said, “They beat me, laid me on a motorcycle, and rode through the fields with me towards Gaza. They brought me to the tunnels; we walked kilometres underground. They beat me in the ribs, even with sticks.” Further exposing the brutality of the Hamas terrorists, the woman said that she was abducted on a motorbike by the terrorists and her head was on one side and her body on the other when on the bike. “When I was on the bike, my head was on one side and the rest of my body on the other side. The young men hit me on the way. They didn’t break my ribs but it was painful and I had difficulty breathing,” she was quoted as saying. “I’ve been through hell … we didn’t think or know we would get to this situation,” she added. The large influential accounts who shared Hamas giving tea to the 85 years old hostages yesterday were only helping the murderous Hamas terrorists spread their propaganda. Yochaved Lifshitz, who escaped captivity by the murderers and Nazis Hamas-ISIS: ""They beat me, laid me on… pic.twitter.com/K3tiFlSwXwThe woman also stated that they were provided with only one time of meal and that barely included a cucumber and some cheese. ‘I was assaulted and beaten with sticks,” she reiterated. However, the released hostage revealed that the terrorists seemed prepared for this situation as they had everything in there that men and women needed including shampoo. “They treated us well and provided all our needs. They also ate the same food as they provided it to us,” the woman added. After being released, the woman could be seen shaking hands with the terrorists. On asking about it, she said that she did so because she was treated ‘well’ during the captivity and was provided with medicines. Notably, Lifshitz’s husband is still held hostage by the Hamas terrorists. It is important to note that the Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the Jewish state on 7th October killing around 1400 Israelis and injuring several others. The terrorists raped the Israeli women, murdered and removed the body parts of the Jewish people, and also didn’t spare the elders and the children. The attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorists marks one of the most brutal attacks in history. After the attack by Hamas, Israel launched a counter-attack on Gaza last week. Ministry of Health in Gaza has reported over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including over 2,000 children and 1,100 women as well as journalists, medical workers, and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

17,25-Oct-23,"Congress-owned paper National Herald spreads hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai, terms their vegetarianism as ‘food terrorism’","This article in the Congress mouthpiece comes from the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. On Tuesday (24th October), Sujata Anandan – the editor of the fraud-accused Congress mouthpiece National Herald – spread hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai. In her article published in the Congress mouthpiece, she called the vegetarianism of Jains and Gujaratis in Mumbai “food terrorism”. Sharing her article on X, Sujata Anandan posted, “Go back to Gujarat if you don’t like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own state.”Go back to Gujarat if you don't like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own statehttps://t.co/UgXZMnU9q9In her article titled ‘Dietary apartheid: Mumbai gets a taste of food terrorism’, Sujata Anandan wrote, “Fish and rice are the staple of Maharashtrians and they don’t see why they should give up their diet to please later settlers, like the Gujaratis who hate even the smell of fish.”Villifying Gujaratis in her article, she described various incidents of what she called food terrorism and accused Gujaratis and Jains in Mumbai of targetting Marathis over food habits. She added, “In an incident in a Mumbai suburb, the Gujaratis were even more aggressive—they started dumping garbage at the doors of the Maharashtrian residents, even dog poop and cow dung. The majority of society in this case backed them up, completely ostracising the family and forcing the Maharashtrians out of the building.”She added, “This kind of food terrorism began in the late 1980s, when former prime minister Morarji Desai forced the shutdown of a non-vegetarian restaurant on the ground floor of his building, claiming that the odours disturbed his tranquillity.”In the guise of batting for the so-called just rights of Marathis in Mumbai, what Sujata Anandan peddled was nothing but an agenda to divide Hindus along various caste lines and regional identities. She wrote, “Social media posts by young Maharashtrians have been raging against the Shethjis and Bhatjis – Gujarati traders and priests – and calling to banish them from Mumbai and Maharashtra! Former Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad of the Nationalist Congress Party pointed out that the Kolis (fishermen), the Agris (who built Mumbai for the British) and the upper-crust Pathare Prabhus (who gave the city a cultural mooring) are the original inhabitants of Mumbai.”Notably, it is the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. She had also posted that the armed forces of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj would loot and rape people. A case was filed against her in the Santa Cruz police station in Mumbai, based on the complaint filed by BJP leader Nitesh Rane. Now, to widen the social divide among Hindu communities, she has resorted to furthering the hatred against Jains, Gujaratis and other upper-caste Hindus calling their vegetarianism food terrorism. In the guise of presenting a case for non-vegetarian sections of the Marathi community, she is creating a social divide between the people of different communities living in Mumbai, by calling out particular castes and communities consuming vegetarian food as food terrorists.

He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.On Tuesday, the Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani who peddles the leftist, Islamist agenda was slammed by netizens for editing a post she posted on the occasion of Dussehra. Sherwani initially tweeted wishing people ‘Happy Dussehra’ and added an emoji of a lamp (diya) which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil. However, she later edited the post and removed the emoji of the lamp. After this, netizens slammed the journalist for editing the post and indicated that she removed the emoji may be because it was a Hindu symbol. One of the users with id @SmokingLiberals commented on the post and questioned, “Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic that? (Did you remove the diya emoji because it was non-Islamic?)” Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic tha? pic.twitter.com/HdN3Cqqo9rMeanwhile, another user also questioned the ‘journalist’ asking about what was the reason behind editing the post and removing the lamp from the original post. “Diya kyu hataya (why did you remove diya?” asked one @ShrivastavAni as he thanked former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria for challenging the ‘journalist’ into praising the Indian culture the other day. Diya 🪔 kyon hataya ? Anyways thank you @DanishKaneria61 pic.twitter.com/WS0CCV2UCL“बस कर पगली …..” – @DanishKaneria61P.S. “🪔” delete kyon kiya?? pic.twitter.com/PcXkZLM7TvHowever, others indicated that this was the first time the ‘journalist’ had posted something aligned with the Hindu festival. They also indicated that this was because of Danish Kaneria who challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet on October 23 to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.The saga began after Sherwani accused the Indian cricket fans of supposedly displaying ‘majoritarianism’ during the 2023 World Cup. Danish Kaneria then asked The Wire ‘journalist’ to leave India if she had issues with her Indian entity. Sherwani however accused Kaneria of posting communal trolls against her. After a series of tweet spat between the duo Kaneria then lashed out at Arfa Khanum Sherwani and said, “Let’s end the debate with a single answer – Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” I am not taking about conversion, majoritarianism, Hindus, Indian Muslims or religion. I am simply talking about your ‘loyalty’. Got it? Let’s end the debate with single answer — “Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” https://t.co/xtuZ06RL0KA day after this, Sherwani who probably never exchanged wishes on any Hindu festival, who believes that saying ‘Bharat Mata ki Jay’ is communal and a majoritarian slogan, wished on Dusshera tweeting, “Happy Dusshera”. While the tweet seemed to shock many of her Islamist followers, others slammed her for editing the lamp (diya) emoji from the tweet, which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil on the Hindu festivals.

19,19-Oct-23,Ram Mandir: 51-inch Balswaroop idol to be handed over to the Temple trust by 31st October,"The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.The decades-long wait of Hindu devotees is going to end in January 2024. The construction work of the Bhavya Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is progressing rapidly. In May, the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust announced that three sculptors are making the Ram Lalla statue to be placed in the Garbhagriha. A member of one of the three teams, Vipin Bhadouriya recently informed that the 51-inch tall Balswaroop idol will be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple trust by 31st October. Bhadouriya asserted, “The statue of Ramlalla, which will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ayodhya’s Ram temple, is almost complete and will be handed over to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust by 31st October.” Bhadouriya has been working around the clock with his mentor, Ganesh Bhatt, who is an eminent sculptor from Karnataka. Regarding Ramlalla’s idol, Bhadouriya noted, “Our idol made of black stone will be the world’s most beautiful statue of Lord Ram, more beautiful than what was imagined. The beauty of the idol would leave people mesmerised.” He further highlighted that the idol depicts a balswaroop Ram, as a five-year-old, standing on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Additionally, the statue would also have fine carvings and designs. All signs related to Lord Ram are carved on the statue which will be 51 inches tall.Bhadouriya added, “I am happy that our efforts have yielded some good results. Our work is on the verge of completion. After some finishing touches, the idol will be handed over to the trust by the end of this month.” However, he is not the only one who is preparing the Ram Lalla idol. In May, General Secretary Champat Rai said, “The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones.” #WATCH | Ayodhya, UP: The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones. It is expected that the idol… pic.twitter.com/0PBCgjXbP0According to the Trust officials, the finest Ram Lalla idol would be placed in the ‘garbhagriha’, while the remaining two would be placed in another temple. The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.Meanwhile, out of the three sculptors, two — Bhadouriya and his mentor Bhatt, and Arun Yogiraj from Mysore – have used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore.According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting. A trust official said, “The stone, weighing 10 tonnes, 6 feet wide, 4 feet thick, and almost one foot long, was specially brought from Nellikaru village in Karkala, almost a month ago.” Whereas the third team comprising Satya Narayan Pandey and his son Shilpi from Jaipur is carving the Ram Lalla statue from ‘A-class’ stone or marble from Makrana. Regarding the usage of Makrana marble, Officials said, “Makrana marble is used for its durability, translucency and fine grains. It is ‘weatherproof’, as it is resistant to erosion and weathering, which makes it ideal for outdoor sculptures and statues.”However, it is important to note that the trust is not using the two Shaligram stones, weighing 14 and 26 tonnes, which arrived from Nepal on 2nd January, for the construction of the Ram Lalla idol.Regarding this Champat Rai said, “The two Devshilas were gifted to us by Nepal. These stones were calcite and quartzite and were procured from the Gandaki River in the Muktinath area of the Himalayan region. However, after consulting many seers, priests, and experts, the trust decided not to use the Devshila from Nepal. It was a difficult decision to take.” The trust has not yet finalised what will be done with Devshila.Further, the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust officials also elaborated on the procedure that will be followed prior to the consecration (pran pratishtha) ceremony of the idol, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take part, on 22nd January.According to the officials, a grand procession will be taken out through the streets of Ayodhya and the Ram Lalla idol will be placed on a special chariot that is under construction. The trust officials said, “The scholars from Kashi will worship River Saryu and give a holy dip to the idol amid the chants of special mantras and hymns. On the final day, the idol will be installed in the garbhagriha.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

He had reached the Sharda Mata Mandir along with his followers on Rath Yatra from Kishkinda – the birthplace of Lord Hanuman in Karnataka.On 15th October (Sunday), the Sharad Navratri Puja was performed at the newly constructed Sharda Temple which is located in the Teetwal border region of North Kashmir’s Kupwara district, near the Line of Control (LoC).

Recently, a new Mandir and Gurudwara were constructed in the same architectural style and on the same sacred land. It was later inaugurated on March 23 of this year by Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Subsequently, the doors of the Mata Sharda Devi Mandir were opened for devotees on the first day of Chaitra Navratri, this year.Regarding this, the Head of Save Sharda Committee Kashmir, Ravinder Pandita said, “It was yet again a historical moment to perform Navratri puja at Sharda temple LoC, for the first time after partition. The temple and Gurudwara that used to exist here were burnt down in tribal raids in 1947 and a new temple and gurudwara has come up on the same piece of land on the same pattern, that was inaugurated by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on 23 March, this year.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

21,15-Oct-23,"Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba","Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

23,25-Oct-23,"Anti-Israel open letter by sociologists could be signed by anyone using any name, vandalism using Nazi names including Hitler now removed","As anyone could sign the open letter using any name, there is no way to know if someone signed multiple times using different names.The Hamas terror attack on Israel and the subsequent military action in Gaza by Israel has exposed how antisemitism runs deep among Islamists and left-liberals. This has been seen in massive anti-Israel and pro-Palestine protests across Europe and North America, where the Hamas terror attack is being contextualised by blaming Israel.Amid this, an open letter by around 2000 ‘Sociologists’ has emerged, where professors and students of various universities have come together in solidarity with Gaza and Palestinians. In the letter, the signatories accused Israel of genocide, claimed that Israeli officials used ‘dehumanising language’ for Hamas terrorists, and tried to contextualise and justify the horrific Hamas terror attack in Israel on 7 October.Many sociologists who have signed the letter have used social media platforms to urge others to sign the same. Several Indian names can be seen in the list of signatories, which includes Nandini Sundar, wife of The Wire founder Siddharth Varadarajan. Professions, research scholars and students in various universities and colleges across the world appear as signatories of the open letter. Names of several elite universities appear in the list, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Brown, Berkeley etc.The Open Letter was published as a public document on Google Docs, and anyone could sign it, using any name, using the Google Forms feature. While it ensured that the letter got a large number of signs, it also meant that it was vandalised by some people. This was evident in some of the names that appeared as signatories.The most prominent name that appeared in the letter was Adolf Hitler, a clear sign of vandalism. The name appeared as Adolf Hitler, professor emeritus, Sociology, University of Austria. Although Hitler was born in Austria, he was not a professor at any stage of his life, as he never studied beyond secondary education.Hamas Has Adolf Hitler's Endorsement Alongside 1,700 Prominent Sociologists pic.twitter.com/IcCuE6xS9NAnother such seemingly fake name in the list is Dr. Josef Mengele, which is the name of an infamous SS officer and doctor better known as “Angel of Death”, because of the deadly experiments he had conducted on the prisoners at the at the Auschwitz II concentration camp.The sociologists who published the open letter calling for the public to ""contextualize"" Hamas terror accepted and then removed ""Dr. Josef Mengele"" as a signatory. Good work, academic sociologists! 👏 https://t.co/1EqYJZhvUu pic.twitter.com/0FcvafQeQ8Josef Mengele’s name appeared as Dr. Josef Mengele, University of Munich, which is technically correct as he received his PhD from the University of Munich. He did his preliminary medicine education at the University of Bonn and did his MD at University of Frankfurt.After such unusual names were discovered by netizens and posted on social media, it seems the people who created the document started a clean-up job. The problematic names are now gone, which means the moderators have removed the obviously fake names, including Hitler and Mengele.It also seems that the signing of the letter has been restricted now, and someone is verifying the names before they are added to the list of signatories. Although the Goole Form to sign the open letter is still available, submitting a name there does not result in the automatic addition of the name to the list, as was the case earlier. As a result, while the number of signatories was gradually increasing earlier, now it is stuck at 1922.However, such moderation was not present in the open letter earlier, which allowed people to add any name they wanted. This means, there is no way to know if someone signed multiple times using different names.In the meanwhile, Israeli sociologists have written a letter in response to the pro-Hamas open letter, urging them to withdraw the letter. They said the lack of recognition for a tragic event and one-sided perspective was presented in the open letter.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On 21st October, he spoke on the topic “Reviving Roots’Roots’ at the University of Toronto, Mississauga, and on 23rd October, he was provided a platform to speak at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon.During his time with Piers Morgan on his show, Hijab kept questioning the authenticity of the reports about the atrocities of Hamas against the people of Israel on 7th October. When Morgan questioned him on his views about the reports of the elderly being kidnapped and toddlers being killed by the Hamas terrorists, the only thing Hijab said was, “Where is the proof?”.Morgan informed him that several mainstream media reports, including from the United Kingdom, verified and published the reports of the atrocities, but the Hijab called them “second source”. He said as he is a “scholar”, he needs “academic” proof of the atrocities. Morgan said there were reports citing experts in the media, but he categorically denied accepting.Speaking about the killing of babies in their cribs and the photograph of the charred dead body of a toddler, Hijab claimed that the photograph was AI-generated. When Morgan said it was some “rouge person” who said it was an AI-generated image and several experts debunked it, Hijab kept saying he needed “an authentic source”. Interestingly, he did not explain what he meant by an “authentic source”.Hijab also tried to justify the horrific actions of Hamas terrorists on 7th October by claiming that Israeli forces have been killing Palestinians for decades and that what Hamas did was “resistance”. He also objected to the comparison of Hamas to ISIS, again for the same reason that Hamas was only showing a form of “resistance”. He failed to provide a base for his theory that resistance would include the killing of civilians.Hijab claimed that what followed the 7th October attack was a war crime and accused Israel of using prohibited weapons like White Phosphorus. There are no authentic sources to support the claim. Furthermore, he failed to acknowledge that Israel has warned and urged the people of Gaza to evacuate as Israel aimed at finishing Hamas once and for all.Throughout the discussion with Morgan, not once did Hijab condemn Hamas for the terrorist attack on Israeli soil, killing 1,300 people in a few hours. For him, what Hamas did was alright, and he kept calling Israel an occupier.On 17 October, a rocket fell on Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital in Gaza. Palestinian Authority claimed around 500 people died and accused Israel of the bombing. Israel countered with footage from Al Jazeera showing a missile originating from Gaza to attack Israel, falling short and hitting the hospital. Further reports showed the rocket fell in the parking lot, and there were apprehensions about the death toll claims.Despite the reports of Israel being behind the attack, which were debunked repeatedly by several media houses and governments, including the US, Hijab continued to paddle the lie. His post after the incident is still on X, and when Morgan questioned him about the source, he did not provide one. Rather, he tried to sway away from the requirement of authenticating the source by saying he was talking about a “primary source” and not a verified source. Didn’t you lecture me yesterday on needing 2-source verified evidence before believing anything in this war? https://t.co/zomM871E3XIn September 2022, Mohammed Hijab was found inciting violence against Hindus in Leicester, UK. In his speeches, he mocked Hinduism and provoked Muslims to attack Hindus. Videos of his speeches were shared widely on social media. He claimed that Hindus were fearful of Muslims. He further suggested that the fear was due to Muslims holding the “truth”.Furthermore, he made derogatory remarks against Hindus and warned them not to protest. He threatened that he and his supporters would attend the Hindus’ protest sites. He was also seen leading a group of masked Islamists in Leicester.Mohammed Hijab also worked alongside hate preacher and fugitive, Zakir Naik, during the fundraising for the construction of a grand mosque and Dawah (proselytism) centre in Oslo, Norway.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

25,23-Oct-23,"Pakistani Professor forced to apologise for teaching Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, declare ‘women inferior to men’: What Islam says about Evolution","Sher Ali was forced to state that women are inferior to men ""in terms of wisdom as specified by Sharia and that unnecessary interaction of women with men is not acceptable."" In a bizarre turn of events, a biology assistant professor from Bannu, Pakistan was forced to apologize on stamp paper for teaching Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. He was also forced to declare that ‘women are inferior to men’ as per Quran and Hadith.  The professor has been identified as Assistant Professor Sher Ali of the Government Postgraduate Degree College. He was compelled to apologize for teaching Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution which is an elementary subject in biology. In addition, he was also made to denounce mixed-gender sessions and assert that ‘women are inferior to men’. In a three-page document, Assistant Professor Sher Ali pledged to the Bannu deputy commissioner’s office that “all scientific and rational ideas that are in conflict with Islamic Sharia, including Darwin’s theory of evolution, are falsehood.” Sher Ali further was forced to state that women are inferior to men “in terms of wisdom as specified by Sharia and that unnecessary interaction of women with men is not acceptable.” Reports mention that Sher Ali has obtained an MSc from the University of Peshawar and an MPhil in human genetics from Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.The incident came to the fore after the video of the said event went viral on social media. The video was shared by Harris Sultan, author of the book The Curse of God: Why I Left Islam on X, formerly known as Twitter. “This is why Pakistan will remain a third-world hell hole. These radical Muslims with handsome beards force a University professor Sher Ali, to condemn the Theory of Evolution and say on record that women are ‘intellectually inferior’ to men as per the Quran and hadith,” Sultan wrote on X. The clerics are not wrong though. The Quran and the most feminist man of all time, Prophet Muhammad did say ""Women are stupid"". Bukhari 2658For a woman to support Islam is like a black man support KKK. pic.twitter.com/EJnKMKS2BmThe issue surrounding Assistant Professor Sher Ali emerged earlier this month when he spoke at a lecture on women’s rights in light of the Constitution and the law in the Domel area. His remarks during the conference weren’t received well with local religious leaders, who accused him of “spreading debauchery and speaking against Islam and local culture”. They also demanded that authorities take strong measures against the Professor. Shortly thereafter, Ali clarified his opinion on teaching Darwin’s theory of evolution which has been incorporated into the educational system. “Chapter 24 of the biology textbook discusses Darwin’s theory of biological evolution and if someone has problems with this topic, then they should approach the government for the removal of the chapter from the course,” he was quoted as saying. The professor also stated that if he did not teach this material, his learners would question his teaching competence and that he always taught Darwin’s theory of biological evolution after obtaining permission from his students.When evolution is mentioned in Islam, it is inevitably associated with Darwinism and, in most situations, is deemed blasphemy. Previous surveys found that at least three-quarters of Muslims oppose the idea entirely or have basic concerns with it, and they frequently refuse to have the evolution theory taught in Muslim societies. These Muslims intend to restrict Muslim minds by creating confusion and ignorance against the theory of evolution. It was the strategy of Muslim scholars and scientists who contested evolution before Darwin. Most notable among them was Al-Jahiz. He detected traces of evolution and adaptability in some animal species without resorting to anti-theistic arguments in his magnum work, The Book of Animals (Kitab Al-Hayawan).As per the reports, the first encounter with Darwin’s theory in the Muslim world emerged in the year 1876 through specific ideological avenues among Muslim intellectuals. Notably, some Muslims believed in the theory and saw it as the only way to save Muslims from backwardness. However, several Muslim ‘reformists’ then, particularly Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, launched a stinging rebuttal to Darwin’s theory in his Al-Radd ‘ala al-Dahriyyin (Refutation of the Materialists), in which he misrepresented Darwin’s theories. He targeted not the Islamists, but the minds who were advocates of Westernisation of the Muslim world. Similarly, the controversial Turkish writer Harun Yahya today has largely moulded the terminology that dominates debates on evolution. He claims that evolution is opposed to Islam since it promotes atheism. Apart from this, there are many religious scholars who deny the theory of evolution based on ‘their religious understandings’ obtained from the ‘religious books’. Also, famous Muslim televangelist, Zakir Naik dismisses evolution as “just a theory,” confusing the term’s popular and scientific connotations. This conflation helps strengthen the language gulf between the religious and scientific groups.It is important to note in the case of evolution that the Quran specifically mentions Adam’s creation as a wondrous creation. It asserts that the human lineage is traced back to him and that Islam is the oldest of all the religions. The mention of Adam is also made in the religious Islamic texts which describe the ‘father of humankind’ as the one chosen by Allah to begin the prophethood on this Earth. Reports mention that the Nine Surahs of the Quran include 25 mentions of the name Adam. Adam has been referred to in Islamic Hadiths as Abul Bashar (the father of humanity), Khalifatullah (God’s representative or vicegerent), and Safi Allah (the one chosen by God).Verse 4 of Surah At-Tin in the Quran mentions that Allah has created man in his best possible capabilities and that humans are the only ones after whose creation God has praised Himself.Muslims believe that Islam is the oldest religion of all religions and that Adam was the first to appear on this land. They believe that he was the first to begin the chain of humanity. There are several mentions of Adam in the Hadith as well which say that Adam was created out of the different colours of mud which signifies people with different skin colours and different mentalities. The Islamic texts further state that God sent Adam to the Biblical Garden of Eden or Garden of God, also known as Terrestrial Paradise when he was hungry and there he created Eve out of the material of air. God then forbade the duo to taste the fruit of immortality and condemned them to ‘live and die’.The Garden of Eden has been mentioned in the Quran as Al-Jannah, which is the commonly used word for paradise in Islam. The book named ‘Islamic Theory of Evolution: The Missing Link Between Darwin and the Origin of Species’ written by TO Shanavas states that Muslims in the Quran are told that the Garden of Eden was paradise itself and that it was located on the Earth. However, it is for Muslims not to be concerned with the exact location of the garden.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

26,23-Oct-23,Ahmedabad emerges as strong bidder for hosting 2036 Olympics: Know all about how the city is preparing for the games,"The 'Olympics', the world's most popular sporting event. As of 2036, it will have been a considerable stretch since the last Olympics took place in Asia. Notably, Beijing hosted the Olympics in 2008, while Tokyo was the host in 2020. Looking ahead, with Paris set for 2024, Los Angeles for 2028, and Brisbane for 2032, the International Olympic Committee is likely to turn its attention to Asia, with India being a prospective candidate. On 14th October, while addressing the 141st International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Mumbai, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India will leave no stone unturned in the efforts to host the Olympics in 2036. PM Modi said, “India is eager to organise the Olympics in the country, there will be no deficiency in the efforts to ensure that the Olympics are organised in India in 2036.”“This is a years-old dream of 140 crore Indians, it is their desire, and we want to fulfil this dream with the cooperation of all of you,” the Prime Minister said addressing the IOC members. This was seen as an important confirmation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India is bidding to host the 2036 Olympics. And when it comes to imagining which Indian city tops the race for hosting the biggest sporting event on the planet, Ahmedabad is the name that appears naturally, thanks to the world-class sports facility developed in the city over the last few years. It, therefore, becomes important to take an account of the preparations of the prime Gujarati city to host the Olympics in 2036.The ‘Olympics’, the world’s most popular sporting event. As of 2036, it will have been a considerable stretch since the last Olympics took place in Asia. Notably, Beijing hosted the Olympics in 2008, while Tokyo was the host in 2020. Looking ahead, with Paris set for 2024, Los Angeles for 2028, and Brisbane for 2032, the International Olympic Committee is likely to turn its attention to Asia, with India being a prospective candidate. With India being the most populous country in Asia, preparations have already begun. Ahmedabad and Delhi are under consideration as potential host cities, alongside a few other cities for some additional events.About eighteen months before Narendra Modi’s public announcement regarding the possibility of hosting the Olympics in India, Narinder Batra, the President of the Indian Olympic Committee, disclosed in February 2022 that India was actively vying to be the host for the 2036 Olympics. Alongside this, he shared additional specifics. 🇮🇳 The IOC Session will go back to India 40 years after its 86th edition, in New Delhi.It is hoped that hosting the #IOCSession in India will highlight the role of sport in the country and celebrate the contribution of India to the Olympic Movement.https://t.co/zh6eAH0mmXNotably, in a show of support for India, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) arranged its annual meeting of full membership in Mumbai for 2023. Recently concluded, the meeting witnessed Prime Minister Modi expressing India’s ambitions to host the games, widely interpreted as the initiation of India’s lobbying efforts for the bid.Ahmedabad initiated preparations for the 2036 Olympic Games a significant time ago. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has been consecutively undertaking projects that will contribute to the advancement of these initiatives.In preparation for the 2036 Olympic Games in Ahmedabad, progress is underway across three key areas viz Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave, Naranpura International Sports Complex, and Riverfront Sports Complex.

27,27-Oct-23,Jamiat Ulema i Hind and Ayodhya case Muslim litigant insist on PM Modi inaugurating mosque after Ram Temple Pran Pratishtha for the sake of secularism,"""Modi is India's PM. He is for Hindus and Muslims both. If he is coming to inaugurate the 'ibadatgaah' (place of worship) of Hindu brothers, then he should also lay the foundation for the masjid,"" Mufti Hisbullah said.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to attend the pran pratishtha of the murti of Lord Ram in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in January next year, several Muslim leaders have now requested PM Modi to lay the foundation of the mosque in Dhannipur village when he visits Ayodhya on 22nd January 2024.Jamiat-i-Ulama Hind president at Ayodhya, Mufti Hisbullah Badshah Khan said that PM Modi is the prime minister of not just Hindus but also of the Muslim community in India. He asserted that when the prime minister is coming to inaugurate the temple of Hindus then he should also lay the foundation stone of the mosque.“Modi is India’s PM. He is for Hindus and Muslims both. If he is coming to inaugurate the ‘ibadatgaah’ (place of worship) of Hindu brothers, then he should also lay the foundation for the masjid,” Mufti Hisbullah said.Meanwhile, Athar Husain, the secretary of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation, the Ayodhya Masjid Trust said that the trust would welcome PM Modi if comes to lay the foundation stone of the mosque in Dhannipur village in Sohawal block nearly 20-25 km away from the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Temple.“We wanted to build a free cancer hospital, a mosque, a community kitchen and a research centre dedicated to Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah Faizabadi, the hero of the 1857 freedom struggle. The PM’s presence can serve our goal. We will welcome him,” Husain said.“Modi is not the PM of any particular community,” former Ayodhya litigant Iqbal Ansari stated. “He is doing everything for the temple; he should do the same for the masjid.”Ansari also expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of the mosque’s construction, stating that while Lord Ram’s idol is scheduled to be installed in the temple in January, the mosque’s foundation stone has yet to be laid. He further asserted that the trustees of the Ayodhya Masjid Trust should be replaced.Mohammad Ismail Ansari, President of the Indian Muslim League expressed his “heartfelt wish” to inaugurate the Dhannipur Mosque also. Essentially, the Muslim side’s insistance that PM Modi inaugurate a mosque after the Pran Pratishtha as well seems to stem out of their insistance that the Prime Minister has to prove his ‘secular’ credentials by inaugurating a mosque as well. Notably, on 25th October, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust formally invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the inauguration of Ram Mandir. The temple trust also announced that the consecration of the Shri Vigraha of Lord Shri Ramlala Sarkar at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya will be done by PM Modi on January 22 next year.As reported earlier, the Mandir trust has decided to commence the consecration of Ram Lalla after Makar Sankranti on January 14, and it will be followed by the 10-day ritual of ‘Pran Pratishtha’ (blessing) of Ram Lalla. According to the Chief Priest of Ram Mandir, Acharya Satyendra Das Ji Maharaj, the rituals will be held from January 15 to January 24.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

28,27-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi returns from a ‘mysterious trip’ to Uzbekistan: List of his secret ‘foreign trips’, meetings with anti-India elements and calls for foreign interference","Rahul Gandhi’s foreign visits are always shrouded in mystery. Besides political speculations, there is often little to no news about his 'secret' travels abroad.On Friday (27th October) morning, Congress scion Rahul Gandhi returned to India from yet another ‘secret trip’ abroad. The development comes just months ahead of crucial Vidhan Sabha elections in several States.As per a report by ANI, Rahul Gandhi reached the Delhi International Airport from Uzbekistan on Friday morning. In a video shared by the news agency, the Congress MP could be seen exiting the airport and sitting in his convoy. #WATCH | Congress MP Rahul Gandhi arrives at Delhi Airport from Uzbekistan. pic.twitter.com/REDfNx48AiIt is notable here that Rahul Gandhi’s foreign visits are always shrouded in mystery. Besides political speculations, there is often little to no news about his foreign travels. The Congress scion has a history of going on vacations without informing the public during election season or at times when his party needs him the most.In April 2022, after poll strategist Prashant Kishor had rejected Congress’ offer to join the party, Rahul Gandhi became untraceable again. Reports mentioned that Gandhi went missing for over 10 days and had gone unreachable, leaving the party to act alone in action during the crisis.Earlier in December 2021, the Wayanad MP had gone for a personal trip to Italy ahead of the campaigns and rallies for then-upcoming Assembly elections in five states scheduled for 2022. He had forced the party to postpone his already scheduled rally in Punjab and had flown to Italy for a ‘personal visit’.Just before Diwali 2021, Rahul Gandhi vanished again, reportedly to London. On November 5 of that year, it was reported that Gandhi was on a ‘long vacation’.He returned after almost a month, just before the winter session commenced in the Parliament. At that time, the BJP took a dig at Gandhi and questioned his trip to London.In September 2021, while the Congress party in Punjab was facing a crisis with Amarinder Singh’s resignation, the Gandhi family was vacationing in Shimla.In December 2020, he left for Italy on the 136th foundation day of his party. His party leaders could not settle on one explanation and further made themselves a target of media questions. In October 2019, fifteen days before the assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra, Gandhi had left, reportedly for Bangkok. In June of that year, before the counting of votes of the parliamentary elections, Rahul Gandhi skipped an important meeting held by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and flew to London for a holiday. In November 2019, BJP leader Rajnath Singh quizzed Rahul Gandhi about his decision to not take Special Protection Group (SPG) personnel along with him on his foreign trips.“In the last two years, Rahul Gandhi was out for 72 days on six foreign trips, but didn’t take SPG cover. Why didn’t he take SPG cover? We want to know what Rahul Gandhi is trying to hide by not taking SPG along on foreign tours when he is a SPG protectee,” he had inquired.Such a deliberate move is reportedly a violation of the SPG Act. In light of repeated violations of security rules both in India and abroad, his SPG protection was revoked in 2019 and was provided Z+ CRPF security cover. Rahul Gandhi was on a 10-day USA tour, where he spoke at the National Press Club, Stanford University and also, to ‘think tanks’, allegedly discussing relations between India and USA. The Hudson Institute tweeted images of Rahul Gandhi in deep conversation with these “think tanks”. Sunita Vishwanath was seated alongside Rahul Gandhi at this event at Hudson Institute. Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of HrHR, which has also signed this letter against Narendra Modi alongside IAMC.Investigating Info-warfare and Psy-war OSINT Disinfo Lab had conducted an investigation revealing that the ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHR)’ had been promoting the misleading narrative of ‘Hindu Vs Hindutva’. The same organisation was also seen endorsing the ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva’ event. Hudson was honored to host @RahulGandhi to discuss the state of US-India relations and further cooperation between both nations. 🇺🇸🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/fIUJhS4ooXAs per Disinfo Lab, HfHR was formed in the year 2019 by two Islamist advocacy groups named Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) and the Organization for Minorities of India (OFMI). Interestingly, the three organisations had formed another outfit called the Alliance for Justice and Accountability (AJA).As per an article in The Hindu, the Alliance for Justice and Accountability had been at the forefront of leading demonstrations against the visit of PM Modi to Houston on September 22, 2019. According to Disinfo Lab, the co-founder of Hindus for Human Rights, Sunita Vishwanath, also runs an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by the Soros Open Society Foundation. Earlier, OpIndia reported in detail how George Soros had been fuelling a dangerous anti-India narrative through media and ‘civil society.’Prominent Indian politician Shri Rahul Gandhi, during his proposed #RahulInUSA tour,would attend several public events. He may not know, but some ‘coordinators’ who are claiming to be associated with events are Pak Jamaat-e-Islami & Muslim Brotherhood-linked frontsA Thread pic.twitter.com/pqaHO6n31LIn September this year, Rahul Gandhi was seen with anti-India Italian leftist politician Fabio Massimo Castaldo. Fabio Massimo Castaldo is the person in a red tie seen on the extreme right in the second photograph of the X post by the Congress party’s official X handle. Fabio Massimo Castaldo’s association with Pervaiz Iqbal Losar – an ISI asset in Europe – puts Rahul Gandhi’s intent to visit the European Parliament under suspicion. It is, therefore, necessary to know more about Fabio Massimo Castaldo and his alleged ISI friend Parvaiz Iqbal Losar.Fabio Massimo Castaldo is a former member of the European Parliament. The Italian leftist politician is friends with Pervaiz Iqbal Loser who is a Europe asset of the Pakistani spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Loser has been working to peddle anti-India propaganda on the Kashmir issue and lobbying against India’s interests in Europe. One of the old X posts by Fabio Massimo Castaldo is a testimony to this. Rahul Gandhi also met MEP Pierre Larrouturou during his September trip.MEP Pierre Larrouturou was one of the key figures behind the anti-India resolution passed in the EU parliament in July over the Manipur issue. In a long social media rant, Pierre Larrouturou even made it clear that the EU resolution was specifically timed to target PM Modi’s France visit.Pierre Larrouturou, representing the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, took the lead in proposing the resolution titled ‘India, the situation in Manipur’.Very honored to welcome @RahulGandhi to the European Parliament today 🇪🇺He is one of the great figures of Indian democracy and has been fighting for years against the ultra-nationalism of the Modi government.With MEPs from 7 different groups, we had a very interesting… pic.twitter.com/59GEvdKU7nAlviina Alametsa, who Rahul Gandhi met in Brussels, was also one of the MEPs who were behind the resolution. Alametsa has been a vocal anti-India campaigner in Europe. In January this year, she participated in a discussion with Prashant Bhushan and Shahrukh Alam, hosted by The London Story, an organization that has been linked to ISI.In July 2023, speaking in the EU plenary, Alametsa stated that external observers must be allowed into Manipur to ‘monitor’ the situation and bring a peaceful resolution. She claimed that the status of human rights and press freedom is deteriorating in India and called for interference in India’s internal affairs.My deepest condolences to those affected by the violence and human rights violations in Manipur. We must end the violence and find a peaceful resolution to the situation. Here is my complete address to the European Parliament on the situation. pic.twitter.com/bqtoXTw8CRAlviina Alametsa has been relentless in her campaigning against India, writing columns, lobbying, and campaigning against Indian interests in the EU. In January 2021, she wrote an article in the EU Observer calling for EU’s support for interfering in the ‘human rights’ situation in India.In her India-centric interactions and narrative, Alametsa has been using platforms to promote or support all anti-India voices, from Teesta Setalvad to Sanjiv Bhat, and Stan Swamy.The instances of Rahul Gandhi seeking ‘foreign help’ for his political gain in India are numerous. After losing election after election, failing to win the trust of the Indian people democratically, he has started declaring to global Leftists that India is a country deep in chaos, where democracy is declining and only he can restore it. In April 2021, speaking at Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, Gandhi insisted that the US government establishment should ‘say more’ about ‘what is happening in India.In 2022, at the ‘Ideas for India’ conference in the United Kingdom, Rahul Gandhi had sought foreign intervention again. During his controversial address, Rahul Gandhi signaled his desire for foreign intervention two times. Not only was Rahul Gandhi demanding foreign intervention into India & attacking our sovereignty on foreign soil but look at this now! Apparently he was sharing stage with Kamal Munir a Pakistani while he was undermining India & Indian institutions Shocking ! Congress must… https://t.co/XYwSIehzEC pic.twitter.com/ZmHsOyuPAOThe first one is during the mention of the Russia-Ukraine issue, and the second one is when he criticized Indian diplomats for being unwilling to take orders from Europeans. In the same conference, he had even compared Ladakh to Ukraine, insinuating that it needs a US intervention.Gandhi has also spoken at the Cambridge University. The Open Society Foundations (OSF) of Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros has been a member of the University of Cambridge’s Guild of Benefactors since 2013. The same George Soros pledged USD 1 Billion to change the regime in India. His foundation provides post-graduate scholarships in “programmes that represent a long-term response to ongoing social and political transformations in the countries served.”Soros has recently openly targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Adani Group. Congress is also playing up the Adani controversy and their leaders, making people wonder if Congress is working in tandem with foreigners interested in regime change, with the 2024 general elections right around the corner.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

30,26-Oct-23,Election Commission issues show cause notice to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for repeating already debunked lie that PM Modi donated ₹21 to Rajasthan temple,"It was already proven that PM Modi didn't use any envelope while making a donation at Devnarayan Temple in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, therefore the envelope that contained ₹21 was not donated by himThe Election Commission (EC) on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over her ‘envelop’ remarks in Rajasthan related to PM Modi’s temple visit. The notice has been issued under clause 2 of part I ‘General Conduct’ of the Model Code of Conduct for political parties and candidates, which prohibits criticism of opponents by invoking their private lives.The action by the poll panel came after the BJP filed a complaint with the EC alleging that Priyanka Gandhi had violated the Model Code of Conduct while addressing a public rally at Dausa in Rajasthan on October 20, 2023. In that meeting, Priyanka Gandhi said that she saw on TV that when an envelope of donation made by Modi at a Devnarayan temple was opened, it had only Rs 21. The BJP on Wednesday made a representation to the Election Commission of India and demanded action against Priyanka Gandhi, accusing her of “invoking the personal religious devotion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi” to make false claims during her poll campaign. “Today we met members of the Election Commission regarding a statement by Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on October 20 that violated the Model Code of Conduct and RP Act. We want to ask ECI if Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is above the Model Code of Conduct. We demand ECI to take action against her,” Law Minister Arjun Meghwal had said.Making the allegation which has already been proven false, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra added that she has seen the news and is not aware if the claim is true or not. She then used it to launch an attack on the BJP, saying that “envelopes” are shown to the public by the party but nothing is found in them after the elections.The notice says that the poll panel has received a complaint alleging that she made false statements in respect of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in her speech.The EC notice said that her statement was examined in light of the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and the speech has been found to be prima facie violative of the aforesaid provisions of MCC. The EC notice asks Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to respond by 5 PM on 30 October, showing cause why appropriate action for violation of Model Code of Conduct should not be taken against her.It is notable that the Model Code of Conduct has come into force with the announcement of poll dates in Rajasthan by the EC on 11 October. The allegations by Priyanka Vadra refer to comments by priest Hemraj Poswal of Devnarayan Temple in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, who claimed that when PM Modi had visited the temple in January this year, he had put an envelope in the donation, and later the envelope was found to have just ₹21. The priest had opened an envelope in front of the camera, claiming that it was the one put by PM Modi in the donation box in front of him. When he opened the envelope, ₹21 was found inside it.Several Congress leaders and others had used the video of the priest’s claim to attack PM Modi. Congress leader Dheeraj Gurjar even went on to claim that PM Modi “deceived” the Gurjar community as he offered merely Rs 21 in the donation box.However, it has been established that the entire claim by the priest was false, as visuals from PM Modi’s visit to the temple show that he didn’t use any envelope while putting money inside the donation box. PM Narendra Modi had put some cash in the box, without any envelope, and it is impossible to tell the amount as the cash donated in such donation boxes gets mixed.Priest Hemraj Poswal was present behind PM Modi when he had put cash without any envelope in the box, but despite that, he went on to claim that a white envelope was used by the PM. And Priyanka Gandhi Vadra repeated that lie in an election rally after the lie was already busted.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

31,26-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi and Satya Pal Malik vent frustration, peddle lies against Modi govt over Article 370, Pulwama, Farm agitation, MSP & more in 28-minute-long talk","Even though the discussion was nothing but brick-batting the Prime Minister, the uncivilised manner in which Satya Pal Malik spoke was unexpectedTalk about storm in a teacup and Rahul Gandhi’s interview/chat with former Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik begins with the message, “On 14th October, I had a conversation with former Governor of J&K, Shri Satya Pal Malik. Do you think the media will broadcast any of this?”One must commend Rahul Gandhi’s efforts to try to catch up with the times as far as content is concerned. But it is not fair for RaGa to take offence with the media for he leaves them dumbfounded. Still, if the media’s attention is what he wants, he must get it.In the 28 minutes 17 seconds-long conversation, the Gandhi scion and Malik touched upon several subjects including Article 370, Pulwama, Farmers, MSP, the Army, Bharat Jodo Yatra, Casteism, Demonetisation, and a new subject, “Liberal Hinduism”, whatever that is.At the centre of their conversation was venting their frustrations over Prime Minister Narendra Modi by making illogical statements, peddling lies, making bizarre insinuations, and sheer ignorance towards their own failures. As I said, a storm in a teacup.Surprisingly, Malik, whose political career spans decades, displayed Rahul Gandhi-level of political understanding of all these issues. Even though the discussion was nothing but brick-batting the Prime Minister, the uncivilised manner in which Satya Pal Malik spoke was unexpected. “Iski, kara raha tha, ” was how Malik addressed whenever talking about the PM. At the same time, Malik put up a great image as that of a loyalist of the Nehru-Gandhi Congress dynasty.In the same sentence, Satya Pal Malik appreciated and criticised Charan Singh saying, “Charan Singh ji was good. But his problem was that he had the dream of becoming the Prime Minister anyhow.” This prompted Rahul Gandhi to wonder why this is the case with politicians in India.“Many of our politicians have this issue that I have to become PM at any cost. By compromising everything, we want to become PM. Why does this happen that there is so much impatience that under any circumstance…Many politicians are like that,” RaGa asked ruminatively.For someone who has been launched, relaunched, and then relaunched again, we ask the same question to Rahul’s mother and former Congress President Sonia Gandhi. Why exactly do Sonia and her loyalists want to make RaGa PM when it was decided at least nine years ago, if not more, that it simply doesn’t seem to be working out?Meanwhile, it was an insinuation by Malik against the Prime Minister that pacified Rahul’s pondering mind. The interview cut out to the next topic after a RaGa-approved reply from Malik who said, “After independence, politics was like duty and people used to perform it like that. Then it became a profession. Now it has become a business.”According to Satya Pal Malik, Jammu and Kashmir “cannot be managed by force or the Army” and J&K’s statehood should be reinstated immediately. According to Malik, J&K was made a union territory because the government suspected that the police could revolt.What followed this bizarre statement was insinuation after insinuation to paint a picture that the Central government doubts the Jammu and Kashmir police. That a former Jammu and Kashmir Governor is pitting the Indian Army against the Jammu and Kashmir police shows just how many challenges India faces internally. Malik said that he had asked the government to reinstate statehood but, according to him, the Centre said that “that is not necessary, everything is going fine”, a point Malik disagrees with.“How is going fine? Insurgency is back. Terrorists are active,” said Malik and Rahul added to this saying that terror incidents have increased. These statements come merely three days after Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbagh Singh said that “terrorism is breathing its last in the union territory”.According to reports, Singh also said that only 10 local youth joined terror ranks this year as compared to 110 in 2022. This is reportedly the lowest number in the UT since late 1980s.In September, the J&K DGP had said that of the 49 terrorists neutralised by security forces in J&K, 40 were foreign nationals. And yet, the former J&K Governor damned official data to propagate his lies and help validate Rahul Gandhi. “It (terror incidents) is happening everywhere. Everyday something happens in Rajouri, Kashmir valley,” Malik said.At the very beginning, it is preposterous that Rahul Gandhi seeks Malik’s “opinion” about the Pulwama terrorist attack in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were martyred on 14th February 2019. Malik responds, almost doing a favour, saying that he won’t say that they (the government) got it done. Seems like Malik did take note of how his interview with Karan Thapar, where he held the Modi government responsible for the Pulwama attacks, was used by Pakistan media to give the terror nation a cleanchit.“But they ignored it in Pulwama and used it politically for themselves because there are his speeches (PM Modi’s) wherein he says that when you go to cast vote, remember the martyrs of Pulwama,” Malik told Rahul. He said that the Modi government wanted to use Pulwama for electoral gains to say that Pakistan did it and we will now defeat them.It is funny though that a little later in the conversation, Malik says that the Prime Minister called him at around 5-6 PM and asked what happened. Malik recalls saying to the PM, “I told him because of our mistake many of our people have died. He told me to stay quiet and not say anything on it.” He said the same was told to him by NSA Ajit Doval.Redirecting attention back to himself, Rahul alleged in the conversation that he was told by the security not to go to the airport to pay homage to the martyrs whose mortal remains were being brought to the airport.“They locked me in a room at the airport and told me “you cannot leave the room”. I asked them “what do you mean?” The martyrs were brought there, Army men were there. The Prime Minister was coming. And they literally locked me with a key and told me I cannot leave. I asked the security that how can they do this. I fought them and left from there,” Rahul alleged.Notably, this is the first time that Rahul Gandhi has mentioned this incident in all the times that he has spoken about Pulwama. Given that all of his claims have been proven wrong and that he has received backlash for politicising the attacks, Rahul seems to have spun this new story.Both Rahul and Malik called the tribute to martyrs at the airport “a show” with the latter saying that the Prime Minister should have gone to Srinagar. So the former J&K Governor is of the view that the right response from the PM should have been to visit Srinagar and direct all security to himself rather than ensuring safety and normalisation.With the security situation in J&K being extremely sensitive and local sentiments undecided, suggesting such experimental endeavours shows just why Satya Pal Malik is a failed politician who continued to lie in the course of the conversation.Malik parroted a lie that was first tweeted by Rahul Gandhi on 22nd February 2019, just eight days after the Pulwama attack. Malik said, “Jis din yeh hua toh yeh National Corbett Park mein shooting kara raha tha apni (The day this happened, he was getting his shooting done at Corbett Park).OpIndia had fact-checked Rahul Gandhi proving that the Prime Minister had completed his forest visit almost an hour before the attack in Pulwama, during which time some photographers took a few snaps of him. The photos were shared by Rahul with the allegations on Twitter and the same was spread like wildfire by his footmen in the Congress and mainstream media.Another big lie that Malik has peddled despite being fact-checked is that the Pulwama attacks happened because the CRPF were not granted the five aircraft which they had sought approval for from the Home Ministry.“Their application was lying at the Home Ministry for four months and it was rejected after four months. They had asked for five aircraft. It wasn’t given and the application was held for four months,” Malik lied.“Agar woh merese maangte toh main immediately kar deta. Mere saamne nahin aane diya. Agar mere saamne aayi hoti toh main kuch usme karta. That was between CRPF and the Home Ministry. (Had they asked me I would have granted. But they did not let me know about it because I would have done something about that. That was between CRPF and the Home Ministry),” Malik said.A report on 17th February 2019 quoted top CRPF officers and government sources saying that even if aircraft had been provided for personnel, convoy movement would still have happened as there were about 4,000 troops and aircraft could not have taken all of them.The CRPF officer said there was a backlog due to weather, and 4,000 personnel needed to be moved. Not all of them could have gone by aircraft.However, individuals like Satyapal Malik consistently spread fake news with help of the people like Rahul Gandhi, who has been… pic.twitter.com/5ey5M2luH0Staying true to his colours, not once did Malik condemn Pakistan-backed terrorism responsible for the several terrorist attacks including Pulwama. Rather his focus was to demotivate and demean Indian intel and the forces. Again drawing a divide between the Kashmir police and the Central forces, the former J&K Governor said, “Not one of the 8-10 link roads on the 10-km stretch where the attack happened was sanitised that day. When I used to send my Kashmir police, we used to halt civil traffic on the entire stretch and would send them after sanitising.” It is shocking that despite being proved wrong on several occassions over Pulwama, Rahul Gandhi was finding it tough to believe when Malik said that heaps of explosive had come from Pakistan.While Rahul decried that the media is reporting only on Israel and not furthering his political agendas, Malik placated him by saying that Rahul has stuck the Adani name to PM Modi which he cannot get rid of now. “People are also saying that Adani has his (PM’s) money,” Malik said. If you think this is funny, wait till you read the next best thing.“The day I did an interview with Karan Thapar, they called all channels and told them not to report it. And then Atiq Ahmed’s case happened and it was the headline for ten days,” Malik claimed.Rahul immediately, and excitedly, jumped in to say that he told his sister Priyanka Gandhi that Atiq Ahmed’s killing was done to distract the people from what you said about Pulwama. “I notied that when you spoke about Pulwama, they were scared,” Rahul stated.“But Atiq Ahmed’s news overshadowed it for 10 days,” Malik added. Yes, Satya Pal Malik thinks he is THAT important even after being ousted.It is still understandable to seek reservation/quota for a community in government ranks, but to ask for caste representation in all institutions, private or public is plain casteist. Rahul Gandhi claims to have found through his “research” that in all Indian institutions, including media and bureaucracy, OBCs, tribals, and Dalits have no representation. “Whether it’s a big media house or anchors, and reports they do not have even a single OBC, Dalit, or Tribal,” Rahul lamented. If Rahul Gandhi had it his way, he would introduce reservation in the media to ensure freedom of press. Who knows, the existence of leftist-laden Press Clubs might just start making sense what with new-found inclusivity and placards crying “Brahminical patriarchy” might not be needed anymore?After Rahul’s monologue on how the current Indian institutional structure and the system of information are preventing their voice from reaching the people because “Modiji turns up the loudspeaker”, Rahul took to the topic of the working class.He spoke about his conversation with carpenters who, he claims, told him that they build the products but they cannot go to the showrooms where the products are sold. “Our work, our labour, but the fruit is not ours,” Rahul cited them. Something tells me the message was beyond the realm of his understanding.Malik was quick to blame the Modi government for this. “It is so unfair, they hike prices, and publicise it. The poor don’t get anything. It is a very exploitative system.” I wonder if Rahul and Malik would be open to elaborating their views of this “exploitative system” if they were to have a casual conversation with a real economist.This was followed by a one-line attack on GST and Demonetisation each despite the fact that DeMo was announced targetting high-value currency, which by no logic can impact the poor. And then Rahul tossed the ball in Malik’s court mentioning farmers’ agitation. Malik was happy to receive it. Malik blamed the Modi government for the changing economic aspirations of the country and the rural youth increasingly venturing out to urban areas for employment opportunities. “Slowly, there will be no farming,” Malik predicted. Spare this writer for not being able to explain how and why the former J&K Governor immediately drew parallels between his imagination that “farming will end” the way “they finished Army” through Agniveer.Malik believes that “Who will sacrifice their lives for such a short period as Agniveer?” These are two daft Indian politicians, one seasoned in daftness, talking about what they think is right and wrong for the people of this country who they don’t even believe to have the patriotism it takes to safeguard the nation.Notably, a day before this mind-boggling interview, Agniveer Gawate Akshay Laxman was martyred in the line of duty in Siachen Glacier making him the first such casualty since the scheme was introduced last year. As for the “short period as Agniveer” that Malik has a problem with, Laxman will be accorded all honours as a “battle casualty”. Even in the Agniveer’s death, Rahul took the opportunity to target the forces. Here’s a fact check by OpIndia Hindi. Laxman’s family will receive Rs 48 lakh non-contributory insurance, ex gratia of Rs 44 lakh, Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer (30%), with an equal matching contribution by the government, and interest thereon. The Agniveer’s next of kin with also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death till the completion of four years which amounts to over Rs 13 lakh, and contribution of Rs 8 lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund, as per government sources. Here are all the facts you need to know about Agniveer.Rahul Gandhi then ranted saying that the Modi government is infiltrating its own people into every institution including the Election Commission (EC). This was Malik cue who alleged that Rahul should get a research done on how all Vice Chancellors in Central Universities appointed in the past one year are connected to the Sangh (RSS). Rahul’s understanding of this baseless and idiotic allegation is that the government is trying to practice “mind control”.Basically, this part of the conversation was about whining about every institution which Rahul Gandhi cannot get his hands on. One wonders why he did not mention the Opposition even once for that too is as good as an institution RaGa cannot seem to have any say or control on.Satya Pal Malik, while trying to explain to Rahul Gandhi what challenges the farmers are facing, said that farmers don’t know that they are becoming poor. He said that the gap between cost of the crop and fertilizer increases and reduces the farmers’ purchasing power year on year. “He doesn’t know that he is becoming poor.” Malik said that MSP should be implemented. But here’s the twist, MSP is already implemented. Oblivious to the fact, Malik went on to describe in detail why MSP should be implemented. He kept falsely accusing the government of cheating the farmers on MSP because Adani made big godowns and purchased crops at a set price. He alleged that the cost of these crops will increase next year and Adani will sell it.This very month, the Modi government announced an increase in the MSP of wheat by Rs 150, the highest hike in MSP prices since Narendra Modi became PM in 2014. In June this year, the Food Ministry informed that more than 830 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured at MSP benefitting 1.22 crore farmers.Rahul indulged in the conversation taking to his favourite part about Adani. He alleged that Adani has captured the entire storage infrastructure. “I saw its effect in J&K, in Himachal.” Malik responded by saying that the effect can be seen in Haryana and Punjab and in Panipat Adani has built huge godowns.The duo alleged that Adani has captured storage to “fine tune” and “increase and decrease” the prices. “This has directly harmed the farmers,” Rahul declared. The solution Malik gave to this imaginary problem was this, “Until and unless there is halla bol (attack) against them, they will not change.”“Or the government should change,” Malik said sowing the seeds of hope into Rahul’s barren head once again. “Aur 6 mahine ki baat hai, main likh ke de raha hoon, bilkul nahin aayenge power mein. (It is a matter of six more months. I give it to you in writing, they will not return to power),” Malik seals the deal in Rahul’s head.By this time, Rahul has switched from the role of an interviewer to being the guest and the guest, Satya Pal Malik, cheering RaGa on. Setting the argument that India is witnessing a clash between RSS and Gandhian ideologies, with the former being violent and latter peaceful, Rahul asks Malik about his views who coins the term “Liberal Hinduism”.“Only if the liberal Hindu thought is promoted only then will the country survive otherwise it will be divided(tuke-tuke ho jayega),” Malik said. Malik said that Gandhi and Congress vision should be promoted amongst the people explaining why they are different.Safe to say that when the Nehru-Gandhi loyalists could not insult the Hindu faith enough what with their attempts to separate “Hinduism” from “Hindutva” and what not, they are not trying to engineer the science of language and reinvent new narratives with the same old intention to malign Hindus.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

32,24-Oct-23,"Bhagwa Love Trap – a figment of Islamist imagination, created merely to harass Hindu men and counter real cases of Love Jihad, claiming lives of Hindu women","Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one's identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis. Love jihad is said to be a figment of the imagination of India’s ‘extreme Hindu religious organisations’. According to Indian media and a large intellectual elite, it is also regarded to be an Islamophobic conspiracy theory concocted by Hindutva ideology followers. They often dismiss it as a political ploy to polarise Hindu voters in support of the now-ruling BJP. Even a sizable portion of Hindus do not believe in the existence of Love Jihad. Despite all the outrage from both parts of society, both are often at odds when it comes to Hindu women eloping with Muslim men in huge numbers.The truth is that many Hindu cinema actors are married to Muslim men in the Indian film business. There is no controversy when renowned actors like Amir Khan, Shahrukh, Saif Ali Khan, and Kabir Khan marry Hindu women. Nawab Pataudi, Azharuddin, and Zahir Khan are all married to well-known Bollywood actresses. Indira Gandhi married Feroz Khan, and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain have Hindu spouses, yet no one has ever questioned it, and no one has ever termed it Love Jihad. Why? Consider following few examples: Case 1. In August 2014, national shooting champion Tara Shahdeo from Ranchi lodged an FIR citing her husband Ranjit Kumar Kohli alias Rakibul Hasan Khan in the national news headlines. Rakibul pretended to be Hindu and introduced his family as a Hindu household. Tara was exposed to his lies when Rakibul asked her to convert to Islam immediately after a marriage sermonised with Hindu tradition in a five-star hotel at Ranchi. Case 2. Sakshi, 16, was slaughtered by her purported lover on May 29 after she refused to continue their connection. Sakshi discovered that the 20-year-old man’s name was Mohammad Sahil, not Sunny. Sahil stabbed the woman numerous times before crushing her skull with a cement boulder in a gruesome murder. Images of Sahil wearing a Kalawa and Rudraksha mala had also emerged.Case 3.  In February 2023, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand’s holy city, Azhar Ahmed pretended to be Rahul in order to marry a Hindu lady, and after nine years of marriage, the victim discovered she was living with a Muslim man. The truth was revealed when she unintentionally discovered an Aadhaar Card at home. It included a picture of her spouse (Rahul), but the name given was Azhar Ahmad. Case 4.  This was December 2022 from Bihar’s Siwan area in which a Muslim guy pretended to be a Punjabi Hindu in order to snare a lady and then abandoned her to seduce another Hindu woman. The accused’s name was Kaleemulla, and he pretended to be Sameer Khanna. He converted the victim, Ratna, to Islam and changed her name to Ayesha Khatun. At the Hussain Ganj police station, a First Information Report (number 324/2022) was filed.Case 5. In July 2022, a case in which a lady, Rachna Solanki, made a police complaint against her husband, Amit Kumar Singh, who was actually Iqrar Qureshi. She discovered the truth nine years after their marriage. Iqrar had two Adhar Cards and his name was put as Amit Kumar on the wedding invitation. On June 18, 2022, the first information report (number 354/2022) was filed at the Jagdishpura police station in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. The pair performed Diwali puja and visited many temples together. Rachna claims to be a devout disciple of Lord Hanuman.Case 6. In June 2022, this case is from Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal area. Here, a woman doctor alleged that the accused, Nehal Khan, disguised as a Hindu in order to ensnare and sexually abuse her and that Nehal lived with her as if she were a Hindu. He accompanied her to temples and observed all rites and holidays. It was impossible for me to believe he was Muslim. Nehal began pressuring Priya to convert to Islam.Let us discuss the common feature in all of these cases: concealing one’s true identity in order to get close to a woman (or very often, a minor). Rakibul hides his identity as being Muslim to marry Tara. To entice the Hindu girl, Iqrar Qureshi disguised himself as Amit Kumar. Sahil Ahmad impersonates Sunny in order to lure Sakshi, marry her, and then murder her when she refuses to convert to Islam. Kallimulla disguised himself as Sameer Khanna to marry Ratna, but when he changed her name to Ayesha Khatun, only she realised it was a ruse. Every day, hundreds of incidents emerge from all around the nation in which Hindu, Christian, Jain, and Sikh females are being deliberately targeted to convert to Islam by this technic. In certain cases, Muslim men who have been captured with Hindu girls by Bajrang Dal activists have admitted to receiving training and money from particular Mosques or Madrassa for suspected Love Jihad, and the incentives are remitted while keeping the girl’s social and financial level in mind.This disguise as Hindu and concealment of Muslim identity in order to entice Hindu girls and women to marry and convert to Islam is known as “Love Jihad” and it is for real. Every day a section of the media is reporting such news of such cases of “Love Jihad.” Concealment of identity is not the only parameter, however. There are several other cases of forced conversion and violence too that have emerged, that fall under the ambit of Love Jihad. The accusation of love Jihad is not about two adults getting along after a courtship, working together, studying together, or even marrying each other where religious considerations are out in the open and anyone who insinuates otherwise is clearly trying to whitewash the criminal phenomenon. Love jihad is often referred to as a hate campaign by Indian intellectual militia. Efforts are being made to establish that it has connections with previous hate campaigns, present white nationalist conspiracy theories, Euro-American Islamophobia etc. It is, however, a well-known fact that Islamists are running this love jihad franchise as their flagship programme as organised and coordinated Jihad against Kafir women – the aims are simple – subjugation and conversion. Let us now discuss the purported “Bhagwa Love Trap” conspiracy theory by Muslim organisations in India. Since the Love Jihad module is in the public domain with the efforts of Hindu organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal etc., Muslim groups have started countering it with a fake narrative. Recently, Muslim scholar Shoeb Jamai accused Hindu organisations of creating Hindu boy’s clubs to seek Muslim females for marriage and conversion. They claimed to have seen a lot of Muslim women hanging out with Hindu men. They showed footage showing Burqa-clad ladies riding pillion on motorbikes with Hindu youths and attacking them, dubbed the “Bhagva Love Trap. According to a covert operation published by Opindia.com, several Islamists, who are part of the “Behen Beti Bachao” group made on social media which the Opindia reporter could sneak into, regularly share Pakistani propaganda content surrounding the “Bhagva Love Trap theory”. These include but are not limited to the inciteful and Hinduphobic videos created by a Pakistani YouTuber Ibne Kazi (screenshots of the WhatsApp chats are attached in the detailed article). The Islamist shared a leaflet, falsely claiming that 10 lakh Muslim women are being converted to Hinduism each year by the RSS as also claimed by Islamic cleric Nomani in his detailed speech. The propaganda-laden material also alleged the conversion and marriage of 800 Muslim women to Hindu men in Amaravati, Maharashtra. Based on reports and social media videos, OpIndia has compiled a total of 50 cases and posted the link on its website, where Hindu men and Muslim women were attacked by extremists under the pretext of the ‘Bhagva love trap.’ The attacks were carried out citing that a sinister plot was underway to convert Muslim women to Hinduism by luring them into a love trap – a conspiracy theory espoused by Sajjad Nomani in his multiple videos.Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one’s identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis.

33,23-Oct-23,The Hindu continues to peddle the North-South divide based on lies peddled by Communist Party leader and JNU prof: 15th Finance Commission report and the truth,"The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India as a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Just about 15 days back, The Hindu published an article on an imaginary North-South divide and we had given a detailed rebuttal to it. In the conclusion of that article, we had written that “It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too.”Looks like someone at The Hindu took this conclusion seriously and wanted to test if we would really repeatedly counter their repeated lies! And so, on the exact same topic, they publish yet another tripe on October 20th.  This time, they interview two known suspects – one is a former Finance minister from the Communist party (Thomas Issac) and another is a former professor from JNU (Balveer Arora). Thomas Issafc, who sadly was a Finance Minister once, opens his argument with an outright lie – that there are only two criteria defined by the Finance Commission on how to devolve funds to the States. We have repeatedly busted this lie but there just seems to be no end to the freedom that The Hindu and their ilk provide to these serial liars. The 15th Finance Commission has the following 6 criteria on which it decides how best to devolve the funds to the states in India. Income Distance and Population from the 2011 census are just 2 of those criteria. States that have done well on Forest and Ecology, Demographic performance and Tax Effort actually get rewarded better by the 15th Finance Commission – which is basically the key demand of these folks! It is intriguing to see this ilk assume that the people of this country will not have access to such basic information, and therefore they can simply publish lies and get away with it. The opening argument of the other interviewee, Balveer Aurora, is even more hilarious. In his infinite wisdom, he says – “if the population basis is being shifted from 1971 to a new figure, the weightage of the population can be adjusted. It is not written in stone that it has to remain the same”. Guess what – the weightage to the population in the 13th FC report was 25%. That report used the 1971 census as a reference (Yes, even for the period 2010 to 2015, we used the 1971 census as a reference!). The weightage to the population in the 15th FC report was 15%. That report used the 2011 census as a reference (Finally, the much-needed correction was made). So, when the population basis was shifted from 1971 to 2011, the weightage given only to the population had already been adjusted from 25% to 15%. How does the former Professor from a reputed university like JNU miss such basic information before making such banal arguments? After years of providing a platform for such hate mongers, The Hindu decides for the first time that they will ask a factual question on this subject – and hence pose the question to Thomas Issac:Thomas Issac goes on a verbal tirade that doesn’t answer the question. He continues to claim that “Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu” are at a loss. This argument that states are at a “loss” has been made by politicians from other states too. KCR’s son, KTR, for example, claims that while Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the central government, it only got back 1.68 lakh crores in return. He went to the extent of calling everyone who countered this fallacious argument “ignoramuses”. This set me thinking. In this particular example, the INR 3.68 lakh crores is the amount that people of India, specifically residing in Telangana, have paid as Tax directly to the Government of India. From this amount, a total of 1.78 lakh crore rupees have been transferred to the Government of Telangana, by the Government of India. KTR makes it sound like 3.68 lakh crores is the tax paid by the government of Telangana to the government of India. Thomas Issac also sounds similar in his arguments.Let’s for a moment just buy this argument. If Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the Government of India, how come only 1.78 lakh crores have come back to the government? Because this amount does not include the 1.08 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on roads in Telangana alone. It does not include the 1.58 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on procuring Paddy and Cotton from Telangana alone. It does not include the nearly 1 lakh crore spent on Infrastructure such as railways, power, energy, irrigation etc for Telangana alone. It does not include thousands of crores spent on welfare scheme beneficiaries in Telangana alone. A rough calculation pegs this amount to about 8.3 lakh crores! Am sure such similar numbers exist for Kerala too. The reason so many numbers for Telangana are known is that Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy released a detailed 320 slide presentation with all these numbers to counter the baseless arguments of KCR and his family. The moot point is that these divisive politicians and media are framing the debate in terms of a balance sheet of money alone. And in the garb of making an argument, they are simply falling back on the same lies again and again. The Hindu has been at the forefront of spreading these lies. Pompous editorials and Op-Eds questioning even the “constitutional propriety” of the 15th FC began back in 2018. In fact, this particular article even made the argument that the terms of reference for the 15th Finance Commission could have been silent on which population census to use. The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

34,20-Oct-23,"Amid the India-Canada standoff, India has, under the leadership of PM Modi, made it clear that we are no more a pushover nation","Besides India's stern approach towards Canada, it's neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's strong retaliation to China's Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by. On Friday, October 20, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their families from India. The move came after India gave an ultimatum for revoking the diplomatic immunity of those diplomats who stayed back post-10th of October even after being told to leave.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada nose-dived after Canada prematurely expelled an Indian diplomat on the 19th of September following baseless allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India went on to promptly expel a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat response to Ottawa’s expulsion of an Indian official over the case. New Delhi also suspended visa services for Canadian nationals.The chill in relations between the two countries was even evident at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10, so much so that even local Canadian media chastised its Prime Minister for being overlooked by Indian and other foreign leaders during the G20 Summit.As the bilateral relations between Canada and India worsen, several reports suggest that Canada has been desperately trying to diffuse the diplomatic row with India. India, on its part, has made it clear that it is no longer a pushover nation and would not tolerate acts of aggression, hate, and intimidation from the rest of the world. The Western big powers like the US, Russia and the UK have also when it came to the India-Canada standoff, chosen to steer clear of strongly-worded public statements that would antagonise India, fearing diplomatic backlash from one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and regarded as a potential counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. This is why, when the Canadian Prime Minister sought the support of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, to raise the issue with India he was snubbed by everyone fearing diplomatic backlash from India.The USA, which has a habit of interfering in every nation’s domestic affairs, was also compelled to toe a fine diplomatic line when it came to the India-Canada standoff. While avoiding offending Canada, one of its closest allies, it did not dare to oppose India. This is primarily because, India, in recent years, has advanced to a position where it is seen as a crucial defence partner for the United States and an essential counterweight to China.The West, including Canada, also has other major things to consider when it comes to India, including strong defence and trade ties that both sides would rather see maintained and strengthened.Another major reason why the Western nations haven’t taken sides may be that they are aware that India’s demand for parity in mutual diplomatic presence does not violate any international rules. In fact, when Canada accused India of flouting the Vienna Convention in withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 41 Canadian diplomats, India strongly responded to Canada’s statement on the withdrawal of some of its diplomats following India’s prod and said no international norm was violated seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. Basically, the Canadian presence in India is much more than India’s presence in Canada. Therefore, India has asked Canada to take back the excess diplomats so that it is equal to Indian diplomats in Canada.Moreover, the West is also completely aware that India is well aware that it has the upper hand and that, if it chooses, it can turn the faucet off and hurt Canada where it hurts the most.The majority of overseas students studying in Canada are from India. According to statistics provided by the Canadian government, around 40% of the 8 lakh international students studying in Canada at the moment are from India. Indian students pay three to five times more in tuition than Canadians do at private colleges. In a sense, Indians support the entire Canadian private college ecosystem, which will disintegrate if the Indian government decides to stop the outflow. Moreover, as many as 600 Canadian companies, including Bombardier and SNC Lavalin, have a strong presence in India, while more than 30 Indian companies, such as infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro have invested billions of dollars in Canada, creating thousands of jobs.The above multiple reasons might have also compelled Canada to change its rhetorics. On Tuesday, October 17, Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly indicated that they did not want to fuel tensions with India by speaking about them publicly — a sharp contrast with the open claims against India that the prime minister made in parliament.It is, however, not just in reference to how India has been handling the India-Canada standoff but there are other recent bold decisions India has taken under the leadership of PM Modi like maintaining a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India’s strong retaliation to China’s Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that India has a mind of its own and that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by.When Modi initially took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, nobody anticipated this three-time Chief Minister of Gujarat and outsider to Lutyens’ Delhi would become the nation’s top diplomat and steer foreign affairs like a gifted artist. But like in other areas, PM Modi took the initiative and crafted a new multi-dimensional foreign policy of multiple allegiances and issue-based allegiances, which has elevated India to the position of most sought-after partner on the international stage. After all, who could hug two arch-rivals- US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin with the same panache?It is difficult to think of another world leader who could tell Putin directly that this is “not the age of war,” and also persuade his foreign minister S Jaishankar to tell the arrogant West that “Europe’s problems are not the world’s problems,” while yet managing to maintain good relations with both sides.The West actually fought tooth and nail to have us on their side during the Russia-Ukraine war. India was under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a position. Despite the pressure, India resisted giving in. India remained impartial in regard to the situation between Russia and Ukraine despite pressure from the West.India’s toughness in its attitude was warmly received by the West, which was demonstrated by the fact that despite their differences, the U.S. and India have continued to have a strong collaboration in areas such as business, technology, security, and education.In June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley. The clash was the worst fighting in over four decades and resulted in severe casualties on both sides. The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was the first time Indian Army personnel were killed on the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.China, still celebrating its victory in 1962, blatantly misjudged India’s resolve to oppose its land-grabbing strategies this time. Beijing was shocked when the Modi administration chose to protect India’s frontiers.At first, India and China had multiple rounds of discussions, both officially in Delhi and Beijing and at the level of military commanders on the LAC. However, when it became clear that China would not back down, India made the decision to establish trade limitations on Chinese investors and goods.The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Modi, authorized the Indian Army to respond to any further escalation on the front lines in a responsible manner. An example of this was the aggressive occupation of specific heights by Indian troops near the Pangong Tso on August 5, 2020, which caught China off guard.With its handling of China’s Galwan misadventure, India once again demonstrated to the world that it is no longer a nation to be taken lightly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

36,17-Oct-23,Promotion of Tribal Cultural Heritage and its importance to decolonisation and nation building: How the Modi govt has taken strides in this direction,"The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.India is home to a diverse array of tribal communities, each with its distinct languages, customs, and traditions, contributing to the rich cultural tapestry of the nation. These indigenous tribes have inhabited India’s forests, hills, and plains for centuries, maintaining a harmonious relationship with nature and embodying a unique way of life. With a deep-rooted connection to their ancestral lands, tribal societies often exhibit close-knit communal structures and practices that have evolved over generations. The tribes of India possess an invaluable repository of traditional knowledge, encompassing everything from herbal medicine and sustainable farming practices to intricate craftsmanship and artistry. Despite modern advancements, preserving the traditions and well-being of India’s tribes remains crucial for maintaining cultural diversity and ensuring the equitable development of the nation. As Padma Vibhushan Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, the main architect of India’s Green Revolution, once said“One of India’s major blessings is the rich store of experience and knowledge available in the rural and tribal areas.”There are some unique indigenous tribal cultural dimensions in India that are not found anywhere else in the world. The Kattunayakan tribe in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India has a unique tradition of honey hunting. They follow ancient rock paintings that depict honey collection methods, utilizing a remarkable symbiotic relationship with local bees to gather honey. The Tangkhul Naga tribe in Manipur celebrates a distinctive festival called Lui-Ngai-Ni, where men demonstrate their strength by pulling huge stone slabs across the village. This ritual reflects their cultural heritage and emphasizes community bonding. The Mishing tribe of Assam practices a unique form of pottery known as Ali Aye Ligang. During this traditional festival, women create intricate clay pots using distinct patterns, symbolizing fertility, prosperity, and the tribe’s cultural identity. The Warli tribe, residing in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, is renowned for its tribal art characterized by simplistic geometric shapes and patterns. This traditional art form, often used to depict daily life and rituals, has gained global recognition for its distinctive style. As an environmental activist and ecofeminist, Dr. Vandana Shiva once said,“The heartbeat of our land is echoed in the rhythms of Adivasi cultures, enriching our diversity and teaching us the value of unity.”Since coming into power in 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has emphasized the preservation and revitalization of India’s diverse cultural heritage, including the rich traditions of its tribal communities. Through various initiatives and policies, the government has aimed to foster a cultural resurgence that recognizes the importance of tribal identity, traditions, and customs. One of the premier initiatives to celebrate and showcase India’s tribal heritage is the Aadi Mahotsav, started in 2017 by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs and the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED).  It gives indigenous communities the opportunity to showcase tribal products and help artisans connect with the mainstream population at the National Tribal Crafts Expo. In 2023, more than one thousand tribal artisans and artists from 28 states and union territories participated in the festival. The Modi government introduced the Van Dhan Yojana, which focuses on enhancing tribal livelihoods through value addition to forest produce. This policy empowers tribal communities by providing them with training, technology, and market access to develop and market their traditional products, thereby preserving their cultural practices. The government established the Eklavya Model Residential Schools to provide quality education to tribal children while respecting their cultural sensitivities. These schools offer a curriculum that combines mainstream education with the preservation of tribal languages, traditions, and knowledge. The government has actively implemented the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA), allowing tribal communities greater control over local governance and natural resources. This policy safeguards their cultural heritage by recognizing their authority over land, resources, and decision-making processes. This government also elected to the seat of the President of India Shrimati Draupadi Murmu, who belongs to the Adivasi Santal community, in a move that truly showed that we are on the path towards decolonization and embracing our indigenous heritage and roots with sincerity and integrity. She once famously said,“It is a tribute to the power of our democracy that a daughter born in a poor house in a remote tribal area can reach the highest constitutional position in India. And it is a matter of great satisfaction for me that those who have been deprived for centuries and those who have been denied the benefits of development, those poor, downtrodden, backwards and tribals are seeing their reflection in me. From Santhal revolution, Paika revolution to Kol revolution and Bhil revolution, all these revolutions had strengthened the tribal contribution in the freedom struggle. I am happy that many museums are being built across the country dedicated to the role of the tribal communities in our freedom struggle. I was born in that tribal tradition which has lived in harmony with nature for thousands of years.”With 2023 being observed as the International Year of Millets, the Union government has laid emphasis on the importance of millets in the tribal areas of the country. Millets are often called `Shree Anna’ which means `the honoured grain’ or `the mother of all grains’. Mahatma Gandhi once said: “In the richness of millets, we rediscover ancient wisdom and modern sustenance, a testament to the resilience of traditional crops.” An interesting case of how governmental intervention has helped with the resurgence of consumption of Shree Anna in rural India is the Korku tribe of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, which had a nutritional downslide in the 1970s when they rapidly moved away from millets to soybean and wheat, leading to malnutrition and worsening health conditions. With interventions such as the formation of Farmer Producer Organizations, the establishment of Centers of Excellence and seed hubs for Shree Anna (supported under the National Food Security Mission), tribes like the Korku have slowly started to move back towards their traditional food practices. Tribal millets like Kodo (Paspalum Scrobiculatum), Kutki (little millet) and Sawa (Indian barnyard millet) are seeing the light of day in a big way again. You may ask how food can be a part of the cultural heritage of a people. Well, food habits are a basic part of a culture that also serves as a point of emotional association, a channel of bonding or discrimination, while having symbolic references. Millets have been identified as foxtail millet (Priyangava – प्रियंगव), Barnyard millet (Anaava – अनाव), and black finger millet (Shyaamaka – श्यामक) in some of the oldest Yajurveda writings from India. The Yimchunger Nagas of Nagaland celebrate the Metumniu festival in August after harvesting millet crops. People in Vishakhapatnam’s tribal communities celebrate the Mandukiya festival in June-July each year, where bullocks are fed ragi-based food items. After observing Deepotsav (Diwali) or on the sacred day of Nagula Chavithi, it is customary to have ragi pancakes or other recipes. Madiah (ragi), along with turmeric, is still smeared on the bride and groom’s body during wedding rites in Madhya Pradesh. In tribal societies, millet seeds are believed to provide protection against evil spirits. To ensure successful hunting and a plentiful harvest, the Pahadi Korwa tribe of Chhattisgarh hang millet stalks in their courtyards.Post-Independence, the documentation of tribal practices in India faced challenges stemming from a lack of dedicated efforts, resulting in the loss of invaluable cultural knowledge as traditional practices faded away undocumented. Historical biases and a focus on mainstream narratives often marginalized tribal communities, leading to inadequate representation and documentation of their unique cultural practices, languages, and rituals. The absence of standardized methodologies and insufficient collaboration between academic researchers and tribal communities hindered comprehensive documentation, limiting the preservation and understanding of India’s diverse tribal heritage. What we often forget when observing and documenting tribal cultural practices is that more often than not it is us who have to learn a lot from them, as put forth by Jaipal Singh Munda, a member of the Constituent Assembly, in the context of democracy as a socio-cultural and political thought,“You can’t teach democracy to tribals. You need to learn democratic values from them. They are the most democratic community on earth.”The Modi government initiated a comprehensive documentation effort to record endangered tribal cultural practices, languages, and rituals. This policy aims to create a repository of knowledge that can be preserved, studied, and shared to prevent the loss of valuable traditions. The comprehensive documentation effort initiated by the Modi government involves ethnographic research teams collaborating with tribal communities to meticulously record and document endangered cultural practices, encompassing rituals, ceremonies, linguistic nuances, and traditional ecological knowledge. This initiative employs modern technologies such as audiovisual recording, digital archiving, and geospatial mapping to create an accessible and comprehensive repository, ensuring the preservation of endangered tribal cultural practices for academic study, community reference, and future revival efforts. There is still ongoing debate and discussion on whether utilizing remote sensing technologies such as drones and satellite imagery for non-intrusive documentation of tribal culture in India is a possible approach, given international examples such as from Guyana, where members of the Wapichan tribe use Parrot Bebop quadcopters for documenting preservation of important cultural and sacred sites to monitoring land-use patterns. The documentation effort by the Modi government also encompasses partnerships with anthropologists, linguists, and cultural experts, who work alongside tribal members to ensure accurate representation and culturally sensitive portrayal, safeguarding the integrity of the recorded practices while fostering a deeper understanding of tribal heritage. This work has also been facilitated by the `double engine model’ with state governments in BJP-run states such as in Goa, where the Tribal Research Institute was registered under the Societies Registration Act 1860 in January 2023 for better documentation and showcasing of tribal culture in Goa.Under the aegis of the BJP government’s Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program, a targeted funding framework was established, channelling resources directly to tribal communities for the documentation, preservation, and revitalization of their endangered cultural traditions. Through this mechanism, tribal groups are invited to submit comprehensive project proposals, outlining specific cultural practices targeted for revival, proposed methodologies, and anticipated outcomes, thus ensuring a focused and strategic approach. The funding allocation process involves an interdisciplinary review panel comprising cultural experts, anthropologists, linguists, and tribal representatives, who evaluate proposals based on criteria such as cultural significance, potential impact, community engagement, and sustainability. Upon approval, the granted funds are disbursed in phases, contingent on achieving predefined milestones, as outlined in the project proposal. This phased disbursement structure promotes accountability, effective resource utilization, and progress tracking. Even the Tribal Sub-Plan, which came into existence in the 1970s for developing areas with tribal concentration, was functional mainly as an accounting exercise without adequate emphasis on the planning and execution of schemes to ensure demonstrable benefits for the scheduled tribes, for decades! The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program allocated a budget of ₹500 crores during its first phase to support various projects aimed at documenting, preserving, and reviving endangered tribal cultural practices. Under this program, over 2,000 traditional tribal festivals and cultural events have been financially supported and promoted, facilitating the preservation and celebration of indigenous rituals and traditions across different tribal communities. The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program has facilitated the establishment of more than 300 Tribal Heritage Conservation Centers across the country, providing resources, technical expertise, and training to tribal communities for the documentation, archiving, and promotion of their cultural practices, languages, and traditions. In addition to financial support, the BJP government has organized capacity-building workshops, technical training, and access to modern tools such as digitization equipment and archival software, empowering tribal communities to execute their revival initiatives efficiently while integrating modern documentation techniques. On the occasion of the Tiranga Utsav on 2 August 2022, Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah released a pictorial book in memory of revolutionary tribal fighters of the Indian freedom struggle in partnership with Amar Chitra Katha.The Modi government has facilitated cultural exchange programs and workshops that bring together different tribal communities to share and learn from each other’s endangered cultural practices. These interactions contribute to the revitalization and cross-pollination of tribal customs. The Union government facilitated a series of cultural exchange workshops, engaging tribal artists and artisans from various regions, allowing them to share and exchange their unique cultural practices, craftsmanship, and traditional knowledge. This was beautifully encapsulated in the words of Indian playwright Mahesh Elkunchwar“Adivasi heritage is a tapestry woven with threads of resilience, wisdom, and cultural diversity that enrich the fabric of our nation.”It has also promoted the work of the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and organised the Tribal Youth Exchange Programme for the development of tribal youth with the support of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The aim of this programme is to provide an opportunity to the tribal youth of 30 selected districts of seven states to visit various places within the country to understand the cultural ethos, language and lifestyles of the people. One key aim of the initiative is to sensitize the tribal youth about their rich traditional & cultural heritage and enable them to preserve it for future generations. This is in conjunction with other existing initiatives such as the Ice Stupa Project Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (Government of India), because of which villagers were able to conserve around 75 lakh litres of water in Ice-Stupas during winters and undertake eco-tourism activities like first Ladakh Ice Climbing Festival that gave the local youth an opportunity to be part of eco-entrepreneurial ventures. The Going Online as Leaders (GOAL) Program, a collaborative effort between Facebook and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA), was inaugurated on May 15, 2020, with the ambitious goal of digitally empowering 5,000 youth from tribal communities in India. By enlisting the expertise of 2500 industry leaders and influencers across diverse fields, the initiative aims to provide personalized mentorship to tribal youth, focusing on digital literacy, life skills, leadership, entrepreneurship, and sector-specific expertise. The comprehensive nine-month program encompasses mentorship, skill-building, and practical experience through a two-month internship, fostering holistic development among tribal mentees. There is also governmental emphasis on intergenerational knowledge transfer within tribal communities, with encouragement given to elders to actively teach younger members about endangered practices, ensuring their continuity and relevance.The Modi government has displayed a strong commitment to the conservation and promotion of tribal languages through a series of targeted initiatives. As part of the ‘Eklavya Model Residential Schools‘ program, launched in 2018, over 460 tribal languages are being preserved and taught, ensuring that indigenous linguistic diversity thrives within the formal education system. Furthermore, the ‘Tribal Language Development Program‘, introduced in 2016, focuses on documenting and revitalizing endangered tribal languages. Through this program, a substantial corpus of tribal language resources, including grammatical structures, dictionaries, and literature, has been compiled. Notably, the government’s ‘Bhasha Sangam’ initiative has celebrated linguistic diversity by featuring over 100 tribal languages on digital platforms, fostering greater recognition and appreciation of tribal linguistic heritage. By embracing digital technology, the Modi government has also launched the ‘Tribes India E-Marketplace,’ facilitating the online promotion and sale of tribal literature, art, and crafts, including works reflecting the linguistic nuances of tribal communities. These comprehensive efforts underscore the government’s dedication to preserving and nurturing the linguistic identities of India’s tribal populations. According to the NEP 2020 report, approximately 220 languages have been lost over the previous 50 years. In addition, 197 Indian languages have been listed as endangered by UNESCO. Even certain official languages included in the Indian Constitution’s Eighth Schedule face significant challenges. A facile bureaucratic procedure sometimes serves as a vehicle for the extermination of a language or dialect. The Criminal Tribes Act was enacted by the British Indian government in 1871 and only repealed in 1952. The Act stigmatised and forced some populations, usually nomadic, to hide their cultural heritage and suppress their languages. Following the 1971 Census, the Indian government declared that any indigenous language spoken by less than 10,000 people would be removed from the list of the country’s official tongues. The dialects which have been considered endangered, include seven from Manipur (Langrong, Aka, Koiren, Aimol, Lamgang, Tarao and Purum), three from Odisha (Manda, Parji and Pengo), two from Assam (Tai Nora and Tai Rong), two from Karnataka (Koraga and Kuruba), two from Arunachal Pradesh (Mra and Na), two from Andhra Pradesh (Gadaba and Naiki), one from Uttarakhand (Bangani), one from Maharashtra (Nihali), one from Jharkhand (Birhor), one from Meghalaya (Ruga), one from West Bengal (Toto), two from Tamil Nadu (Kota and Toda) and four from Himachal Pradesh (Baghati, Handuri, Pangvali and Sirmaudi). Languages such as Ghallu, Helgo, Adhuni, Dichi and Katagi have gone extinct. The Union government under the leadership of Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan has initiated a Scheme for the Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India in December 2021 and been working with the Mysuru-based Central Institute of India Languages on the protection, preservation and documentation of all Indian language.The Union government has sanctioned over ₹864 lakh to various universities, institutes and academies for research on tribal medicinal practices and healing traditions nationwide, with the government data revealing that over ₹312 lakh has been allotted to the Patanjali Research Institute in Haridwar. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, operating under the AYUSH ministry, has undertaken a commendable Tribal Health Care Research Programme aimed at documenting and preserving the wealth of folk medicines and traditional practices present across diverse regions of India. Implemented through 16 peripheral institutes across the country, Tribal Health Care Research Programme not only collects valuable information but also extends healthcare services to tribal populations. Collaborative efforts with institutes like Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh and Bangalore in Karnataka involve comprehensive medico-ethno botanical surveys, meticulously cataloguing medicinal flora and indigenous practices. The National Medicinal Plants Board, under its scheme, has similarly sponsored ethnobotanical research projects in states like Assam, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, delving into the medicinal usage of local flora by tribal communities. The National Medicinal Plants Board’s creation of an accessible database, detailing the therapeutic attributes and habitats of over 7,000 medicinal plant species, stands as a significant resource for preserving and sharing traditional knowledge. Collaborating with CSIR, the Ministry of AYUSH established the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, a comprehensive repository of codified texts translated into multiple languages, serving as a preventive measure against the misappropriation of India’s traditional medicinal wisdom. Furthering these efforts, the establishment of the North Eastern Institute of Folk Medicine in Arunachal Pradesh aims to safeguard and promote the rich tapestry of folk medicine practices unique to the North Eastern Region. These endeavours collectively reflect a profound commitment by the Indian government to uphold and propagate traditional healing practices while ensuring their rightful recognition and protection. The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved the establishment of the National Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh as an autonomous organization under the Ministry of AYUSH in November 2019. Sowa-Rigpa, a traditional medical system indigenous to the Himalayan region, has found widespread popularity and practice in various Indian locales, including Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Darjeeling (West Bengal), Himachal Pradesh, and the Union Territory of Ladakh, now extending its influence throughout the entire country.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP government has made significant strides in promoting tribal cultural resurgence in India. Through various policies and initiatives, the government has recognized and empowered tribal communities, encouraged the revival of traditional arts and crafts, preserved tribal languages, promoted festivals, improved educational facilities, and safeguarded tribal medicinal knowledge. The efforts made by the government have not only preserved the cultural diversity of India but also empowered tribal communities to actively participate in the nation’s growth and development. However, there is still much to be done to ensure that the tribal cultural heritage remains vibrant and thriving for future generations. It is imperative for the government and society as a whole to continue supporting and preserving the unique cultural identity of India’s tribal communities. The resurgence and safeguarding of tribal culture enable the restoration of traditional knowledge systems, such as Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa, which challenge the dominance of Western medicine and contribute to the decolonization of India’s healthcare practices. The revival of tribal cultural practices, such as the Dokra metal craft and Warli painting, helps counter the erasure of indigenous art forms caused by colonial influences, fostering cultural diversity and decolonizing artistic expressions. The resurgence of tribal culture also aids in decolonization by reinforcing land rights, as exemplified by the Forest Rights Act of 2006, which recognizes and restores tribal communities’ historic rights over forest lands, challenging colonial-era dispossession. The revival of tribal cultural practices fosters eco-friendly cultural tourism, as seen in the case of the Konkan Railways’ “Tribal Village Tourism” initiative, promoting economic growth, community well-being, and decolonization of tourism narratives. The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

37,22-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi spreads propaganda against Agnipath Scheme again by claiming kin of deceased Agniveer soldier will not get anything, here are the facts","As per the Agnipath Scheme, the next of kin of Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, who died in Siachen, will receive receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amountDays after the Aam Aadmi Party tried to play politics over the death of an Agniveer soldier, now Rahul Gandhi has joined the dirty politics after the death of another Agniveer jawan recruited under the new Agnipath Scheme.On Sunday (22 October), the Indian Army’s Fire and Fury Corps informed that Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman lost his life while posted at Siachen glacier. The corps posted on X, “All ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest condolences to the family.”Quartered in snow silent to remain, when the bugle calls they shall rise and march againAll ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest… pic.twitter.com/1Qo1izqr1UThe reason for the death has not been disclosed, but most tragedies in the glacier take place due to natural disasters like avalanches.Hours after the news of the unfortunate death of the soldier was published, Rahul Gandhi alleged that his family will not get any monetary payment, like the families of regular soldiers receive. In a tweet posted in Hindi, Rahul Gandhi wrote, “A young man was martyred for the country – no gratuity, no other military facilities during his service, and no pension to his family in martyrdom.”He further added that ‘Agniveer is a plan to insult the heroes of India’.However, the allegations of Rahul Gandhi are completely false and inaccurate, and families of Agniveer soldiers who loss their lives in the line of duty do receive emoluments. As per terms of the Agnipath scheme, the Next of Kin of an Agniveer soldier who becomes a battle casualty receives ₹48 Lakh as Non-Contributory Insurance and Ex-gratia of ₹44 Lakh.Apart from this, they also receive the amount of Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer, with an equal matching contribution by the Govt, along with the interest. The Next of Kin will also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death, till the completion of four years, which is the term of employment under the scheme. In Gawate Akshay Laxman’s case, his family will receive over ₹13 lakh in total.Not only this, the next of kin will also be paid a contribution of ₹8 Lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund. Therefore, the next of kin of the deceased Agniveer soldier will receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amount, which could be around ₹3 lakh for service of one year, as opposed to Rahul Gandhi’s claim that they will receive no monetary compensation.It is notable that the Seva Nidhi contribution is 30% of the salary.Rahul Gandhi has been spreading false propaganda against the Agnipath scheme, designed to turn Indian defence forces into a younger force. He had claimed that the scheme was a brainchild of RSS, alleging that the scheme will create unemployed youths trained in guns, and will create violence in society. It is notable that Rahul Gandhi’s comments were the same as comments of PFI about the scheme, who had claimed that retired Agniveer soldiers would form groups to attack Muslims.Earlier AAP had attacked the scheme after Agniveer Amritpal Singh died in Kashmir, after he was not provided a military guard of honour during his funeral. The Indian Army had then explained that no guard of honour or military funeral was provided because Singh had died from suicide. The Army said that this is the existing policy for all soldiers, not just for Agnivereers.“Unfortunate instances of death arising out of suicide/self-inflicted injury, irrespective of the type of entry, are accorded due respect by the Armed Forces along with deep and enduring empathy with the family. Such cases, however, are not entitled to Military Funerals as per the extant Army Order of 1967, in vogue,” the Indian Army had said.Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveer soldiers are recruited for 4 years, with 25% of them eligible to enter regular service. Soldiers who retire after four years will be opportunity to work at PSUs, government agencies, paramilitary forces, and state governments. They also receive the Sewa Nidhi corpus of ₹10.04 lakh along with interest.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

38,21-Oct-23,"Welfare Party of India may be an example of communist stupidity in supporting terror, but they didn’t use the Italy flag to support Palestine: Fact Check","The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, in the party's flag, there is a yellow olive leaves symbol and the words 'Welfare Party' in the middle panelAs Israel continues its military action against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas, Islamists and leftists worldwide, who are traditionally anti-Israel, are protesting against Israel and in support of Hamas and Palestine. A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine. In the photos, the protestors were seen carrying a large number of flags which looked like the Italian flag.HILARIOUS: The Welfare Party in Kerala, India took out a rally in favor of Palestinians, but they brought ITALIAN flags instead of the Palestinian flag. 😂 #FreeItaly https://t.co/GKRCuyYuYUAs both the flags of Italy and Palestine contain the same colours, red, green and white, people assumed that the party mistakenly picked the wrong flag for the protest.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest.

39,13-Oct-23,Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral,"The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

40,07-Oct-23,Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The event has been hosted in association with ‘The National Centre for the Performing Arts’ (NCPA) .Hasan is infamous for his 2009 video where he was heard equating non-Muslims with ‘cattle’ and homosexuals with ‘paedophiles.’He was heard saying, “Once we lose the moral high ground we are no different from the rest, of the non-Muslims, from the rest of those human beings who live their lives as animals, bending any rule to fulfill any desire.”It must be mentioned that Mehdi Hasan is of Indian descent but was raised in England since childhood. Although he apologised for his remarks in 2019, it becomes clear that his upbringing in a diverse, multicultural society could not rid him of his disdain for non-Muslims.Gentle reminder that Mehdi Hasan has previously characterized non-Muslims as immoral people who “live their lives like animals,” and lumped homosexuals together with pedophiles and sexual deviants in his speeches: pic.twitter.com/ZX7b71EvSJIn April 2022, the MSNBC anchor went on a tirade against PM Modi and cast aspersions on India’s secularism.“Putin. Orban. Le Pen. We talk a lot in the West about the rise of far-right authoritarians and yet we never mention India’s Narendra Modi and his BJP. I did a deep-dive into India under Modi & new warnings of an anti-Muslim genocide,” Hasan claimed.In the video, he equated Hindu Nationalism in India (a nation that was divided on religious lines) with white Supremacy in the West, which is an ideology based on race. His sinister agenda was to equate Hindutva with Anti-Semitism.Putin. Orban. Le Pen.

In reality, they do not make any such distinction.His specific targeting of Hindu world leaders such as Narendra Modi and Tulsi Gabbard was criticised by HAF founder Shuag A Shukla, who called out his Hinduphobic antecedents in 2019.Whenever @narendramodi comes to town, Hindus like @tulsigabbard and Hindu orgs come under attack by activists trying to connect them to Hindu nationalism. @mehdihasan takes it further by connecting them to a mass murderer.

42,25-Oct-23,"Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar, ‘Adolf Hitler’ and 1900+ others sign an open letter contextualising Hamas attack against Israel, where they raped and beheaded Jews","The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on IsraelAs Israeli military action against Hamas in Gaza continues in retaliation to the horrific terror attack by Hamas on 7 October, some 1,900 plus odd sociology “professors” have signed an open letter in solidarity with Gaza and Palestinians. The letter, a typical rant of the left, calls to “contextualise” the Hamas terror attack that killed over 1400 innocent Israelis and displaced over 2 lakh civilians in Israel.The letter is published as a Google Doc, which can be edited by people after requesting edit permission. NEW: 1,700 sociology professors sign a letter accusing Israel of ""genocide"" and arguing that Hamas terror must be ""contextualize[d]"" as a response to ""75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.""Our professors are seething with hatred against the West. pic.twitter.com/4lxaftaepzThe excerpt reads, “As educators, it is our duty to stand by the principles of critical inquiry and learning, to hold the university as a space for conversation that foregrounds historical truths, and that contextualises this past week’s violence in the context of 75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.”The letter has been signed by professors from Ivy League institutes including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Brown, Berkeley, and others. And when the elite progressives have it in them to speak up for the downtrodden, how can the Indian left not rise to the occasion?We've scanned the list and found Nandini Sundar, wife of American far-left propagandist, Siddarth Varadarajn is one of the signatories supporting Hamas. Also includes students from IITB, TISS, OP Jindal, Ashoka Uni, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, AMU, DU. https://t.co/0k1q2okbup pic.twitter.com/Mtz71dUe19Among those Indians who have signed the letter are The Wire founder Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar. The Indian signatories to the letter also include students from IIT Bombay, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), OP Jindal, Ashoka University, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), and Delhi University (DU).However, the biggest irony in this document is that a person named Adolf Hitler, who is listed as “professor emeritus, Sociology, University of Austria”, is also a signatory. However, it seems that later the name Adolf Hitler was removed from the list. It is notable that anyone can add any name to sign the list, and it is possible that some of the names are fake. Moreover, as it is an editable document, someone is going through the signatures and removing suspicious sounding names, like Adolf Hitler. Spotted this signature. https://t.co/1u2II2bW87 pic.twitter.com/QZBU5h470dMoreover, the letter does not condemn Hamas and the carnage it unleashed on Israeli civilians on 7th October killing more than 1,400 innocent people and taking more than 200 captive. It also does not mention that Hamas is also responsible for the death of civilian Palestinians in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, as Hamas has been preventing civilians from evacuating north Gaza despite repeated warnings by Israel. In fact, the letter just once makes the mention of Hamas violence but does so in a matter-of-factly tone as against the 300+ words of Israel bashing.The letter reads, “While claiming its actions are a justifiable response to recent Hamas violence against Israeli civilians, it has targeted the civilian Palestinian population of Gaza, while exhibiting little regard for the loss of human life.” The letter also objects to the use of ‘racist and dehumanizing language’ for Hamas terrorists, referring to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant using the term ‘human animals’ for Hamas terrorists/Clearly, the signatories made the conscious choice of not acknowledging the unspeakable atrocities inflicted upon Israeli civilians including women and babies. One of the appalling excerpts of the letter reads, “This latest siege comes as a continuation and escalation of the daily violence Palestinians faced for decades from Israeli colonisation…”The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on Israel. That it consciously leaves out any mention of the terrorist attack and talks about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the context of “75 years of settler colonial occupation” shows how this global left lobby joiin forces with Islamists to legitimise the existence of terrorist groups like Hamas.Netizens have pointed out several flaws in the letter that raise questions on the credibility of the letter and even its signatories. There is of course the Adolf Hitler bit for one. “Academic Watchdog” Steve McGuire shared an image of the document while it was still accepting entries showing how the document has several collaborators.Captured some editing. pic.twitter.com/qT7wYQ8VEcX user Abigail Anthony, a writer, also recorded a 33-second video while the document was still being edited. The name of Michael Rodriguez, an associate professor of Sociology at the University of California, appeared on the document as he deleted an entry signed by the name Jill Biden, “professor, Northern Virginia Community College”.The apparent editor of the document goes by the name Michael Rodriguez-Muniz on X, formerly Twitter, and had first shared the open letter on 18th October calling on his followers to sign and share the same.Open Letter: Sociologists in Solidarity with GazaSign on and Share!https://t.co/xPLyic4welAuthor and Professor Bradley Campbell pointed out on X that the list consists of “mostly usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students. Some of them aren’t even in sociology departments.” 1700 sounds like a lot, but go through the list and it's mostly the usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students. Some of them aren't even in sociology departments. So things are bad, but not as bad as you might think. https://t.co/mOnyo1gvuDAnother X user, Grayson Quay, pointed out that the document can be signed under whatever name one wants. “They don’t vet the signatures at all. I just signed as Reinhard Heydrich,” he wrote.Do what you will with this information, but you can just sign this under whatever name you want. They don't vet the signatures at all.I just signed as Reinhard Heydrich. https://t.co/dFMyPTI1zuThis nth letter by the global left lobby comprising of 1,700 self-proclaimed “sociologists” whose credibility is as good as a troll account on social media, shows their sheer desperation to find an excuse of a “cause” to clutch on to. The left has become irrelevant, and Islam is their only fodder for the want of a revolution. Unfortunately, the victims of terrorism continue to have to fight for justice even in death.

43,25-Oct-23,Islamists claim freed Israeli hostage was treated well by Hamas but here is what she said narrating her harrowing tale at the hands of the Islamic terrorists,"The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. On Tuesday (24th October), the Hamas terrorists released two Israeli hostages among the 220 held. The two released women have been identified as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yochaved Lifshitz, 85. It is being said that these two were released due to their deteriorating health conditions. While some of the Islamist and left-leaning media portals lauded the terrorists for providing the women with medicines and tea during their captivity, one of the women talked to the media after being released by Hamas terrorists to reveal that she went through hell and was beaten by the terrorists. Several Islamists and media channels released videos of the women being released by the Hamas terrorists and claimed that they were being offered tea and cookies. The Islamists also referred to the Hamas terrorists who launched a brutal attack on Israel on 7th October as ‘fighters’. One of the social media users shared a video clip by BBC News media which showed the daughter of one of the women praising the terrorists. The daughter could be heard saying that the terrorists treated her mother well and gave her medicines. “Another major blow to Israel’s propaganda machine,” the Islamist user tweeted. Another major blow to “israel’s” propaganda machineSharon Lifshitz, daughter of the released elder who shook the hands of her Hamas captors during the hand off, Yochaved Lifshitz“My mom is saying that they were very friendly toward them”ON BBC! IN PLAIN ENGLISH! #Gaza pic.twitter.com/khYqvWSclgSeveral media houses also painted the terrorists as ‘generous’ for providing the released hostages with tea and cookies. However, one of the released women talked to the media and said that she was assaulted and that she had to see hell on this Earth due to Hamas terrorists.🚨Hamas published a video showing the moment of the release of two female hostages – Nurit Cooper and Yochaved Lifshitz.

One can safely assume that any victim of such brutality when released from captivity, would be in shock. The victim would also feel gratitude for being released from captivity and in that moment, while still in fear by the torture inflicted, may make statements downplaying the brutality that she faced. However, for the Islamists to use that moment of fear to whitewash the crimes mounted by Jihadis only goes to show how desperate the ecosystem is to paint Hamas as good samaritans instead of the terrorists they are, given that they beheaded, raped, tortured and murdered over 1500 Jews. The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. While the Islamists tried to paint Hamas as good samaritans, the released woman identified as Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, said, “They beat me, laid me on a motorcycle, and rode through the fields with me towards Gaza. They brought me to the tunnels; we walked kilometres underground. They beat me in the ribs, even with sticks.” Further exposing the brutality of the Hamas terrorists, the woman said that she was abducted on a motorbike by the terrorists and her head was on one side and her body on the other when on the bike. “When I was on the bike, my head was on one side and the rest of my body on the other side. The young men hit me on the way. They didn’t break my ribs but it was painful and I had difficulty breathing,” she was quoted as saying. “I’ve been through hell … we didn’t think or know we would get to this situation,” she added. The large influential accounts who shared Hamas giving tea to the 85 years old hostages yesterday were only helping the murderous Hamas terrorists spread their propaganda. Yochaved Lifshitz, who escaped captivity by the murderers and Nazis Hamas-ISIS: ""They beat me, laid me on… pic.twitter.com/K3tiFlSwXwThe woman also stated that they were provided with only one time of meal and that barely included a cucumber and some cheese. ‘I was assaulted and beaten with sticks,” she reiterated. However, the released hostage revealed that the terrorists seemed prepared for this situation as they had everything in there that men and women needed including shampoo. “They treated us well and provided all our needs. They also ate the same food as they provided it to us,” the woman added. After being released, the woman could be seen shaking hands with the terrorists. On asking about it, she said that she did so because she was treated ‘well’ during the captivity and was provided with medicines. Notably, Lifshitz’s husband is still held hostage by the Hamas terrorists. It is important to note that the Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the Jewish state on 7th October killing around 1400 Israelis and injuring several others. The terrorists raped the Israeli women, murdered and removed the body parts of the Jewish people, and also didn’t spare the elders and the children. The attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorists marks one of the most brutal attacks in history. After the attack by Hamas, Israel launched a counter-attack on Gaza last week. Ministry of Health in Gaza has reported over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including over 2,000 children and 1,100 women as well as journalists, medical workers, and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

44,25-Oct-23,"Congress-owned paper National Herald spreads hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai, terms their vegetarianism as ‘food terrorism’","This article in the Congress mouthpiece comes from the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. On Tuesday (24th October), Sujata Anandan – the editor of the fraud-accused Congress mouthpiece National Herald – spread hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai. In her article published in the Congress mouthpiece, she called the vegetarianism of Jains and Gujaratis in Mumbai “food terrorism”. Sharing her article on X, Sujata Anandan posted, “Go back to Gujarat if you don’t like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own state.”Go back to Gujarat if you don't like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own statehttps://t.co/UgXZMnU9q9In her article titled ‘Dietary apartheid: Mumbai gets a taste of food terrorism’, Sujata Anandan wrote, “Fish and rice are the staple of Maharashtrians and they don’t see why they should give up their diet to please later settlers, like the Gujaratis who hate even the smell of fish.”Villifying Gujaratis in her article, she described various incidents of what she called food terrorism and accused Gujaratis and Jains in Mumbai of targetting Marathis over food habits. She added, “In an incident in a Mumbai suburb, the Gujaratis were even more aggressive—they started dumping garbage at the doors of the Maharashtrian residents, even dog poop and cow dung. The majority of society in this case backed them up, completely ostracising the family and forcing the Maharashtrians out of the building.”She added, “This kind of food terrorism began in the late 1980s, when former prime minister Morarji Desai forced the shutdown of a non-vegetarian restaurant on the ground floor of his building, claiming that the odours disturbed his tranquillity.”In the guise of batting for the so-called just rights of Marathis in Mumbai, what Sujata Anandan peddled was nothing but an agenda to divide Hindus along various caste lines and regional identities. She wrote, “Social media posts by young Maharashtrians have been raging against the Shethjis and Bhatjis – Gujarati traders and priests – and calling to banish them from Mumbai and Maharashtra! Former Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad of the Nationalist Congress Party pointed out that the Kolis (fishermen), the Agris (who built Mumbai for the British) and the upper-crust Pathare Prabhus (who gave the city a cultural mooring) are the original inhabitants of Mumbai.”Notably, it is the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. She had also posted that the armed forces of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj would loot and rape people. A case was filed against her in the Santa Cruz police station in Mumbai, based on the complaint filed by BJP leader Nitesh Rane. Now, to widen the social divide among Hindu communities, she has resorted to furthering the hatred against Jains, Gujaratis and other upper-caste Hindus calling their vegetarianism food terrorism. In the guise of presenting a case for non-vegetarian sections of the Marathi community, she is creating a social divide between the people of different communities living in Mumbai, by calling out particular castes and communities consuming vegetarian food as food terrorists.

45,24-Oct-23,"‘Did you remove diya because it was non-Islamic’: Arfa Khanum Sherwani gets slammed for tweet on Dusshera, others wonder if tweet was ‘Danish Kaneria effect’","It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.On Tuesday, the Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani who peddles the leftist, Islamist agenda was slammed by netizens for editing a post she posted on the occasion of Dussehra. Sherwani initially tweeted wishing people ‘Happy Dussehra’ and added an emoji of a lamp (diya) which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil. However, she later edited the post and removed the emoji of the lamp. After this, netizens slammed the journalist for editing the post and indicated that she removed the emoji may be because it was a Hindu symbol. One of the users with id @SmokingLiberals commented on the post and questioned, “Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic that? (Did you remove the diya emoji because it was non-Islamic?)” Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic tha? pic.twitter.com/HdN3Cqqo9rMeanwhile, another user also questioned the ‘journalist’ asking about what was the reason behind editing the post and removing the lamp from the original post. “Diya kyu hataya (why did you remove diya?” asked one @ShrivastavAni as he thanked former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria for challenging the ‘journalist’ into praising the Indian culture the other day.

They also indicated that this was because of Danish Kaneria who challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet on October 23 to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.The saga began after Sherwani accused the Indian cricket fans of supposedly displaying ‘majoritarianism’ during the 2023 World Cup. Danish Kaneria then asked The Wire ‘journalist’ to leave India if she had issues with her Indian entity. Sherwani however accused Kaneria of posting communal trolls against her. After a series of tweet spat between the duo Kaneria then lashed out at Arfa Khanum Sherwani and said, “Let’s end the debate with a single answer – Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” I am not taking about conversion, majoritarianism, Hindus, Indian Muslims or religion. I am simply talking about your ‘loyalty’. Got it? Let’s end the debate with single answer — “Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” https://t.co/xtuZ06RL0KA day after this, Sherwani who probably never exchanged wishes on any Hindu festival, who believes that saying ‘Bharat Mata ki Jay’ is communal and a majoritarian slogan, wished on Dusshera tweeting, “Happy Dusshera”. While the tweet seemed to shock many of her Islamist followers, others slammed her for editing the lamp (diya) emoji from the tweet, which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil on the Hindu festivals.

46,19-Oct-23,Ram Mandir: 51-inch Balswaroop idol to be handed over to the Temple trust by 31st October,"The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.The decades-long wait of Hindu devotees is going to end in January 2024. The construction work of the Bhavya Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is progressing rapidly. In May, the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust announced that three sculptors are making the Ram Lalla statue to be placed in the Garbhagriha. A member of one of the three teams, Vipin Bhadouriya recently informed that the 51-inch tall Balswaroop idol will be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple trust by 31st October. Bhadouriya asserted, “The statue of Ramlalla, which will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ayodhya’s Ram temple, is almost complete and will be handed over to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust by 31st October.” Bhadouriya has been working around the clock with his mentor, Ganesh Bhatt, who is an eminent sculptor from Karnataka. Regarding Ramlalla’s idol, Bhadouriya noted, “Our idol made of black stone will be the world’s most beautiful statue of Lord Ram, more beautiful than what was imagined. The beauty of the idol would leave people mesmerised.” He further highlighted that the idol depicts a balswaroop Ram, as a five-year-old, standing on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Additionally, the statue would also have fine carvings and designs. All signs related to Lord Ram are carved on the statue which will be 51 inches tall.Bhadouriya added, “I am happy that our efforts have yielded some good results. Our work is on the verge of completion. After some finishing touches, the idol will be handed over to the trust by the end of this month.” However, he is not the only one who is preparing the Ram Lalla idol. In May, General Secretary Champat Rai said, “The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones.” #WATCH | Ayodhya, UP: The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones. It is expected that the idol… pic.twitter.com/0PBCgjXbP0According to the Trust officials, the finest Ram Lalla idol would be placed in the ‘garbhagriha’, while the remaining two would be placed in another temple. The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.Meanwhile, out of the three sculptors, two — Bhadouriya and his mentor Bhatt, and Arun Yogiraj from Mysore – have used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore.According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting. A trust official said, “The stone, weighing 10 tonnes, 6 feet wide, 4 feet thick, and almost one foot long, was specially brought from Nellikaru village in Karkala, almost a month ago.” Whereas the third team comprising Satya Narayan Pandey and his son Shilpi from Jaipur is carving the Ram Lalla statue from ‘A-class’ stone or marble from Makrana. Regarding the usage of Makrana marble, Officials said, “Makrana marble is used for its durability, translucency and fine grains. It is ‘weatherproof’, as it is resistant to erosion and weathering, which makes it ideal for outdoor sculptures and statues.”However, it is important to note that the trust is not using the two Shaligram stones, weighing 14 and 26 tonnes, which arrived from Nepal on 2nd January, for the construction of the Ram Lalla idol.Regarding this Champat Rai said, “The two Devshilas were gifted to us by Nepal. These stones were calcite and quartzite and were procured from the Gandaki River in the Muktinath area of the Himalayan region. However, after consulting many seers, priests, and experts, the trust decided not to use the Devshila from Nepal. It was a difficult decision to take.” The trust has not yet finalised what will be done with Devshila.Further, the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust officials also elaborated on the procedure that will be followed prior to the consecration (pran pratishtha) ceremony of the idol, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take part, on 22nd January.According to the officials, a grand procession will be taken out through the streets of Ayodhya and the Ram Lalla idol will be placed on a special chariot that is under construction. The trust officials said, “The scholars from Kashi will worship River Saryu and give a holy dip to the idol amid the chants of special mantras and hymns. On the final day, the idol will be installed in the garbhagriha.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

47,16-Oct-23,"Sharad Navratri Puja celebrated at Sharda Temple near LOC for the first time since partition, Home Minister Amit Shah shares news","Swami Govindananda Saraswati of Hampi was also present during the historic Puja ceremony. He had reached the Sharda Mata Mandir along with his followers on Rath Yatra from Kishkinda – the birthplace of Lord Hanuman in Karnataka.On 15th October (Sunday), the Sharad Navratri Puja was performed at the newly constructed Sharda Temple which is located in the Teetwal border region of North Kashmir’s Kupwara district, near the Line of Control (LoC). Devotees in large numbers from far-flung areas attended the Navratri Puja as it was for the first time after partition that the Navratri Pujas were held in the Sharda Temple in Kashmir. Taking to X, Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserted that the development has a profound spiritual significance noting that the puja rituals were held for the first time since 1947 in the Sharda Temple in Kashmir. He noted that he was fortunate to inaugurate Mata Sharda Temple in March 2023.  Home Minister Shah tweeted, “It is a matter of profound spiritual significance that for the first time since 1947, the Navratri pujas have been held in the historic Sharda Temple in Kashmir this year. Earlier in the year the Chaitra Navratri Puja was observed and now the mantras of the Shardiya Navratri puja resound in the shrine.

Recently, a new Mandir and Gurudwara were constructed in the same architectural style and on the same sacred land. It was later inaugurated on March 23 of this year by Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Subsequently, the doors of the Mata Sharda Devi Mandir were opened for devotees on the first day of Chaitra Navratri, this year.Regarding this, the Head of Save Sharda Committee Kashmir, Ravinder Pandita said, “It was yet again a historical moment to perform Navratri puja at Sharda temple LoC, for the first time after partition. The temple and Gurudwara that used to exist here were burnt down in tribal raids in 1947 and a new temple and gurudwara has come up on the same piece of land on the same pattern, that was inaugurated by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on 23 March, this year.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

48,15-Oct-23,"Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba","Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

50,25-Oct-23,"Anti-Israel open letter by sociologists could be signed by anyone using any name, vandalism using Nazi names including Hitler now removed","As anyone could sign the open letter using any name, there is no way to know if someone signed multiple times using different names.The Hamas terror attack on Israel and the subsequent military action in Gaza by Israel has exposed how antisemitism runs deep among Islamists and left-liberals. This has been seen in massive anti-Israel and pro-Palestine protests across Europe and North America, where the Hamas terror attack is being contextualised by blaming Israel.Amid this, an open letter by around 2000 ‘Sociologists’ has emerged, where professors and students of various universities have come together in solidarity with Gaza and Palestinians. In the letter, the signatories accused Israel of genocide, claimed that Israeli officials used ‘dehumanising language’ for Hamas terrorists, and tried to contextualise and justify the horrific Hamas terror attack in Israel on 7 October.Many sociologists who have signed the letter have used social media platforms to urge others to sign the same. Several Indian names can be seen in the list of signatories, which includes Nandini Sundar, wife of The Wire founder Siddharth Varadarajan. Professions, research scholars and students in various universities and colleges across the world appear as signatories of the open letter. Names of several elite universities appear in the list, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Brown, Berkeley etc.The Open Letter was published as a public document on Google Docs, and anyone could sign it, using any name, using the Google Forms feature. While it ensured that the letter got a large number of signs, it also meant that it was vandalised by some people. This was evident in some of the names that appeared as signatories.The most prominent name that appeared in the letter was Adolf Hitler, a clear sign of vandalism. The name appeared as Adolf Hitler, professor emeritus, Sociology, University of Austria. Although Hitler was born in Austria, he was not a professor at any stage of his life, as he never studied beyond secondary education.Hamas Has Adolf Hitler's Endorsement Alongside 1,700 Prominent Sociologists pic.twitter.com/IcCuE6xS9NAnother such seemingly fake name in the list is Dr. Josef Mengele, which is the name of an infamous SS officer and doctor better known as “Angel of Death”, because of the deadly experiments he had conducted on the prisoners at the at the Auschwitz II concentration camp.The sociologists who published the open letter calling for the public to ""contextualize"" Hamas terror accepted and then removed ""Dr. Josef Mengele"" as a signatory. Good work, academic sociologists! 👏 https://t.co/1EqYJZhvUu pic.twitter.com/0FcvafQeQ8Josef Mengele’s name appeared as Dr. Josef Mengele, University of Munich, which is technically correct as he received his PhD from the University of Munich. He did his preliminary medicine education at the University of Bonn and did his MD at University of Frankfurt.After such unusual names were discovered by netizens and posted on social media, it seems the people who created the document started a clean-up job. The problematic names are now gone, which means the moderators have removed the obviously fake names, including Hitler and Mengele.It also seems that the signing of the letter has been restricted now, and someone is verifying the names before they are added to the list of signatories. Although the Goole Form to sign the open letter is still available, submitting a name there does not result in the automatic addition of the name to the list, as was the case earlier. As a result, while the number of signatories was gradually increasing earlier, now it is stuck at 1922.However, such moderation was not present in the open letter earlier, which allowed people to add any name they wanted. This means, there is no way to know if someone signed multiple times using different names.In the meanwhile, Israeli sociologists have written a letter in response to the pro-Hamas open letter, urging them to withdraw the letter. They said the lack of recognition for a tragic event and one-sided perspective was presented in the open letter.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

51,25-Oct-23,"After Piers Morgan, Toronto and Saskatchewan Unis platform anti-semitic, anti-Hindu, pro-Hamas Mohammed Hijab, who had also instigated Leicester violence against Hindus","Hijab also tried to justify the horrific actions of Hamas terrorists on 7th October by claiming that Israeli forces have been killing Palestinians for decades and that what Hamas did was ""resistance"". He also objected to the comparison of Hamas to ISIS, again for the same reason that Hamas was only showing a form of ""resistance"". He failed to provide a base for his theory that resistance would include the killing of civilians.Mohammed Hijab, a radical Islamic preacher, is gaining traction amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. In less than a week, Hijab has been given a platform to spread disinformation and question the authenticity of reports of Hamas’ atrocities against Israeli people during the terrorist attack on 7th October.On 17th October, Hijab was a guest on Piers Morgan Uncensored. On 21st October, he spoke on the topic “Reviving Roots’Roots’ at the University of Toronto, Mississauga, and on 23rd October, he was provided a platform to speak at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon.During his time with Piers Morgan on his show, Hijab kept questioning the authenticity of the reports about the atrocities of Hamas against the people of Israel on 7th October. When Morgan questioned him on his views about the reports of the elderly being kidnapped and toddlers being killed by the Hamas terrorists, the only thing Hijab said was, “Where is the proof?”.Morgan informed him that several mainstream media reports, including from the United Kingdom, verified and published the reports of the atrocities, but the Hijab called them “second source”. He said as he is a “scholar”, he needs “academic” proof of the atrocities. Morgan said there were reports citing experts in the media, but he categorically denied accepting.Speaking about the killing of babies in their cribs and the photograph of the charred dead body of a toddler, Hijab claimed that the photograph was AI-generated. When Morgan said it was some “rouge person” who said it was an AI-generated image and several experts debunked it, Hijab kept saying he needed “an authentic source”. Interestingly, he did not explain what he meant by an “authentic source”.Hijab also tried to justify the horrific actions of Hamas terrorists on 7th October by claiming that Israeli forces have been killing Palestinians for decades and that what Hamas did was “resistance”. He also objected to the comparison of Hamas to ISIS, again for the same reason that Hamas was only showing a form of “resistance”. He failed to provide a base for his theory that resistance would include the killing of civilians.Hijab claimed that what followed the 7th October attack was a war crime and accused Israel of using prohibited weapons like White Phosphorus. There are no authentic sources to support the claim. Furthermore, he failed to acknowledge that Israel has warned and urged the people of Gaza to evacuate as Israel aimed at finishing Hamas once and for all.Throughout the discussion with Morgan, not once did Hijab condemn Hamas for the terrorist attack on Israeli soil, killing 1,300 people in a few hours. For him, what Hamas did was alright, and he kept calling Israel an occupier.On 17 October, a rocket fell on Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital in Gaza. Palestinian Authority claimed around 500 people died and accused Israel of the bombing. Israel countered with footage from Al Jazeera showing a missile originating from Gaza to attack Israel, falling short and hitting the hospital. Further reports showed the rocket fell in the parking lot, and there were apprehensions about the death toll claims.Despite the reports of Israel being behind the attack, which were debunked repeatedly by several media houses and governments, including the US, Hijab continued to paddle the lie. His post after the incident is still on X, and when Morgan questioned him about the source, he did not provide one. Rather, he tried to sway away from the requirement of authenticating the source by saying he was talking about a “primary source” and not a verified source. Didn’t you lecture me yesterday on needing 2-source verified evidence before believing anything in this war? https://t.co/zomM871E3XIn September 2022, Mohammed Hijab was found inciting violence against Hindus in Leicester, UK. In his speeches, he mocked Hinduism and provoked Muslims to attack Hindus. Videos of his speeches were shared widely on social media. He claimed that Hindus were fearful of Muslims. He further suggested that the fear was due to Muslims holding the “truth”.Furthermore, he made derogatory remarks against Hindus and warned them not to protest. He threatened that he and his supporters would attend the Hindus’ protest sites. He was also seen leading a group of masked Islamists in Leicester.Mohammed Hijab also worked alongside hate preacher and fugitive, Zakir Naik, during the fundraising for the construction of a grand mosque and Dawah (proselytism) centre in Oslo, Norway.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

52,23-Oct-23,"Pakistani Professor forced to apologise for teaching Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, declare ‘women inferior to men’: What Islam says about Evolution","Sher Ali was forced to state that women are inferior to men ""in terms of wisdom as specified by Sharia and that unnecessary interaction of women with men is not acceptable."" In a bizarre turn of events, a biology assistant professor from Bannu, Pakistan was forced to apologize on stamp paper for teaching Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. He was also forced to declare that ‘women are inferior to men’ as per Quran and Hadith.  The professor has been identified as Assistant Professor Sher Ali of the Government Postgraduate Degree College. He was compelled to apologize for teaching Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution which is an elementary subject in biology. In addition, he was also made to denounce mixed-gender sessions and assert that ‘women are inferior to men’. In a three-page document, Assistant Professor Sher Ali pledged to the Bannu deputy commissioner’s office that “all scientific and rational ideas that are in conflict with Islamic Sharia, including Darwin’s theory of evolution, are falsehood.” Sher Ali further was forced to state that women are inferior to men “in terms of wisdom as specified by Sharia and that unnecessary interaction of women with men is not acceptable.” Reports mention that Sher Ali has obtained an MSc from the University of Peshawar and an MPhil in human genetics from Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.The incident came to the fore after the video of the said event went viral on social media. The video was shared by Harris Sultan, author of the book The Curse of God: Why I Left Islam on X, formerly known as Twitter. “This is why Pakistan will remain a third-world hell hole. These radical Muslims with handsome beards force a University professor Sher Ali, to condemn the Theory of Evolution and say on record that women are ‘intellectually inferior’ to men as per the Quran and hadith,” Sultan wrote on X. The clerics are not wrong though. The Quran and the most feminist man of all time, Prophet Muhammad did say ""Women are stupid"". Bukhari 2658For a woman to support Islam is like a black man support KKK. pic.twitter.com/EJnKMKS2BmThe issue surrounding Assistant Professor Sher Ali emerged earlier this month when he spoke at a lecture on women’s rights in light of the Constitution and the law in the Domel area. His remarks during the conference weren’t received well with local religious leaders, who accused him of “spreading debauchery and speaking against Islam and local culture”. They also demanded that authorities take strong measures against the Professor. Shortly thereafter, Ali clarified his opinion on teaching Darwin’s theory of evolution which has been incorporated into the educational system. “Chapter 24 of the biology textbook discusses Darwin’s theory of biological evolution and if someone has problems with this topic, then they should approach the government for the removal of the chapter from the course,” he was quoted as saying. The professor also stated that if he did not teach this material, his learners would question his teaching competence and that he always taught Darwin’s theory of biological evolution after obtaining permission from his students.When evolution is mentioned in Islam, it is inevitably associated with Darwinism and, in most situations, is deemed blasphemy. Previous surveys found that at least three-quarters of Muslims oppose the idea entirely or have basic concerns with it, and they frequently refuse to have the evolution theory taught in Muslim societies. These Muslims intend to restrict Muslim minds by creating confusion and ignorance against the theory of evolution. It was the strategy of Muslim scholars and scientists who contested evolution before Darwin. Most notable among them was Al-Jahiz. He detected traces of evolution and adaptability in some animal species without resorting to anti-theistic arguments in his magnum work, The Book of Animals (Kitab Al-Hayawan).As per the reports, the first encounter with Darwin’s theory in the Muslim world emerged in the year 1876 through specific ideological avenues among Muslim intellectuals. Notably, some Muslims believed in the theory and saw it as the only way to save Muslims from backwardness. However, several Muslim ‘reformists’ then, particularly Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, launched a stinging rebuttal to Darwin’s theory in his Al-Radd ‘ala al-Dahriyyin (Refutation of the Materialists), in which he misrepresented Darwin’s theories. He targeted not the Islamists, but the minds who were advocates of Westernisation of the Muslim world. Similarly, the controversial Turkish writer Harun Yahya today has largely moulded the terminology that dominates debates on evolution. He claims that evolution is opposed to Islam since it promotes atheism. Apart from this, there are many religious scholars who deny the theory of evolution based on ‘their religious understandings’ obtained from the ‘religious books’. Also, famous Muslim televangelist, Zakir Naik dismisses evolution as “just a theory,” confusing the term’s popular and scientific connotations. This conflation helps strengthen the language gulf between the religious and scientific groups.It is important to note in the case of evolution that the Quran specifically mentions Adam’s creation as a wondrous creation. It asserts that the human lineage is traced back to him and that Islam is the oldest of all the religions. The mention of Adam is also made in the religious Islamic texts which describe the ‘father of humankind’ as the one chosen by Allah to begin the prophethood on this Earth. Reports mention that the Nine Surahs of the Quran include 25 mentions of the name Adam. Adam has been referred to in Islamic Hadiths as Abul Bashar (the father of humanity), Khalifatullah (God’s representative or vicegerent), and Safi Allah (the one chosen by God).Verse 4 of Surah At-Tin in the Quran mentions that Allah has created man in his best possible capabilities and that humans are the only ones after whose creation God has praised Himself.Muslims believe that Islam is the oldest religion of all religions and that Adam was the first to appear on this land. They believe that he was the first to begin the chain of humanity. There are several mentions of Adam in the Hadith as well which say that Adam was created out of the different colours of mud which signifies people with different skin colours and different mentalities. The Islamic texts further state that God sent Adam to the Biblical Garden of Eden or Garden of God, also known as Terrestrial Paradise when he was hungry and there he created Eve out of the material of air. God then forbade the duo to taste the fruit of immortality and condemned them to ‘live and die’.The Garden of Eden has been mentioned in the Quran as Al-Jannah, which is the commonly used word for paradise in Islam. The book named ‘Islamic Theory of Evolution: The Missing Link Between Darwin and the Origin of Species’ written by TO Shanavas states that Muslims in the Quran are told that the Garden of Eden was paradise itself and that it was located on the Earth. However, it is for Muslims not to be concerned with the exact location of the garden.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

53,23-Oct-23,Ahmedabad emerges as strong bidder for hosting 2036 Olympics: Know all about how the city is preparing for the games,"The 'Olympics', the world's most popular sporting event. As of 2036, it will have been a considerable stretch since the last Olympics took place in Asia. Notably, Beijing hosted the Olympics in 2008, while Tokyo was the host in 2020. Looking ahead, with Paris set for 2024, Los Angeles for 2028, and Brisbane for 2032, the International Olympic Committee is likely to turn its attention to Asia, with India being a prospective candidate. On 14th October, while addressing the 141st International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Mumbai, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India will leave no stone unturned in the efforts to host the Olympics in 2036. PM Modi said, “India is eager to organise the Olympics in the country, there will be no deficiency in the efforts to ensure that the Olympics are organised in India in 2036.”“This is a years-old dream of 140 crore Indians, it is their desire, and we want to fulfil this dream with the cooperation of all of you,” the Prime Minister said addressing the IOC members. This was seen as an important confirmation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India is bidding to host the 2036 Olympics. And when it comes to imagining which Indian city tops the race for hosting the biggest sporting event on the planet, Ahmedabad is the name that appears naturally, thanks to the world-class sports facility developed in the city over the last few years. It, therefore, becomes important to take an account of the preparations of the prime Gujarati city to host the Olympics in 2036.The ‘Olympics’, the world’s most popular sporting event. As of 2036, it will have been a considerable stretch since the last Olympics took place in Asia. Notably, Beijing hosted the Olympics in 2008, while Tokyo was the host in 2020. Looking ahead, with Paris set for 2024, Los Angeles for 2028, and Brisbane for 2032, the International Olympic Committee is likely to turn its attention to Asia, with India being a prospective candidate. With India being the most populous country in Asia, preparations have already begun. Ahmedabad and Delhi are under consideration as potential host cities, alongside a few other cities for some additional events.About eighteen months before Narendra Modi’s public announcement regarding the possibility of hosting the Olympics in India, Narinder Batra, the President of the Indian Olympic Committee, disclosed in February 2022 that India was actively vying to be the host for the 2036 Olympics. Alongside this, he shared additional specifics. 🇮🇳 The IOC Session will go back to India 40 years after its 86th edition, in New Delhi.It is hoped that hosting the #IOCSession in India will highlight the role of sport in the country and celebrate the contribution of India to the Olympic Movement.https://t.co/zh6eAH0mmXNotably, in a show of support for India, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) arranged its annual meeting of full membership in Mumbai for 2023. Recently concluded, the meeting witnessed Prime Minister Modi expressing India’s ambitions to host the games, widely interpreted as the initiation of India’s lobbying efforts for the bid.Ahmedabad initiated preparations for the 2036 Olympic Games a significant time ago. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has been consecutively undertaking projects that will contribute to the advancement of these initiatives.In preparation for the 2036 Olympic Games in Ahmedabad, progress is underway across three key areas viz Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave, Naranpura International Sports Complex, and Riverfront Sports Complex.

Furthermore, the premises will incorporate designated areas for meetings and interviews, administrative and media offices, hotels, retail spaces, various facilities, food courts, and parking facilities capable of accommodating approximately 7,500 cars and 15,000 two-wheelers.Naranpura Sports Complex, covering a vast expanse of over 20 acres, is expected to incur an estimated cost of Rs 584 crore. The selection of the site meticulously considers all the prerequisites essential for an international sports venue, ensuring an impeccable mobility plan for both players and visitors.In 2021, the Union Finance Ministry allocated a budget of Rs 10,000 crore for the development of a multi-sports facility near Vardan Tower in Naranpura. Following the approval of the Rs 584 crore budget, the construction of the expansive complex commenced at full pace. Encompassing an area of 82,509 square meters, the complex will house an array of cutting-edge amenities and will be under the complete management of the Union Sports Ministry.The primary highlights of the complex will feature an Olympic-sized aquatic centre, tennis court, and an athletic stadium, among others.

55,27-Oct-23,AAP says there is no data to identify the prime source of pollution in Delhi after blaming stubble burning in Punjab for years,"Delhi AAP minister Atishi cited the lack of data as an impediment to drafting the anti-pollution policy of the Delhi government.On Wednesday (25th October), Delhi minister and AAP leader Atishi said that there was no official data available that could tell the different sources contributing to the pollution in Delhi. Notably, many times in the past, AAP leaders including Atishi and Arvind Kejriwal have blamed the stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana for the pollution in Delhi. Now, the AAP government in Delhi is saying that it is clueless about which source contributes how much to the pollution in the national capital. Atishi cited the lack of this data as an impediment to drafting the anti-pollution policy of the Delhi government.Atishi said, “Pollution in Delhi is a serious concern in winter months. The Delhi government has been working for the last 8 years to reduce this ever-increasing pollution level. Many independent organisations have made several reports. These reports say that the pollution levels in Delhi have gone down in the past few years.”आधिकारिक तौर पर ऐसा कोई भी आंकड़ा नहीं है जिससे पता चल सके कि दिल्ली में किन स्त्रोतों से कितना प्रदूषण होता हैइस समस्या के समाधान के लिए –July, 2021 में दिल्ली सरकार ने Real Time Source Study करवाने का Milestone फैसला लिया कि किस source से दिल्ली में कितना प्रदूषण होता है।… pic.twitter.com/ygkAhTSEFAShe added, “However, we have identified a major impediment in reducing pollution in Delhi. The problem is that there is no official data to know what are the different sources of air pollution in Delhi and how much pollution comes from which sources in Delhi. Unless the government knows exactly how much a source contributes to this pollution, the government cannot make any policy to control this pollution.”In October 2022, the Delhi cabinet inked an MoU with IIT-Kanpur to conduct a real-time pollution source apportionment study in the national capital. Valued at over Rs 12 crore, the project received Rs 10 crore from the Delhi government for the acquisition of necessary equipment and the establishment of a centralised data collection supersite.However, the AAP government in Delhi is accusing DPCC Chairman Ashwani Kumar of arbitrarily halting the study by stopping the remaining payment of Rs 2 Cr. At a press conference held to blame him for the failure of the Delhi government, Atishi highlighted the lack of data on the sources contributing to Delhi’s pollution. This comes in stark contrast to her earlier citation of ICAR data three years ago, which blamed stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab for the problem.Notably, the AAP government in Delhi and many AAP leaders have blamed the stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana for the pollution in Delhi multiple times in the past. In an old post on X (formerly Twitter), Atishi said, “Data clearly shows that Delhi pollution is directly correlated with stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab. The criminal negligence of the CMs in not solving this problem has caused a public health emergency in Delhi. Strongest action should be taken against them!” This post was shared on 18th November 2020. Atishi had cited the ICAR data to back her claims.On 17 October 2021, Delhi’s chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal said, “For the past month, I have been tweeting data of air quality in Delhi. Pollution has increased in the last 3-4 days and it is due to stubble burning in neighbouring states. Farmers in neighbouring states are compelled to burn stubble as their governments are doing nothing for them (towards stopping stubble burning).”In 2018, Arvind Kejriwal held a press conference to show satellite pictures of Punjab and Haryana as proof of stubble burning causing pollution in Delhi. Going into the minute details of the stubble burning, Kejriwal even gave a partial clean chit to Haryana. He said, “Very little area in north Haryana had stubble fires, large parts of Punjab could be seen as affected. If you see honestly, then there are just a few places of Haryana in it. In Punjab, stubble is being burnt in the entire area, especially Bathinda and Amritsar.”Flagging the satellite images from Punjab, Arvind Kejriwal said, “I heard a statement of Punjab Pollution Control Board chairman saying that stubble was not being burnt in the state and that the air quality index of the state was good. These pictures show stubble being burnt. Where is all this smoke going? Is it disappearing and directly going to Pakistan?”On 24 November 2020, Atishi said, “The Air Quality Commission formed by the central government is responsible for controlling the pollution in Delhi and NCR. Today, we had a meeting with the commission, because we all know that it is difficult to breathe in Delhi in the months of October and November. Our agenda has two main points. Firstly, the commission should order the governments of Haryana and Punjab to implement the solution devised by the AAP government in Delhi to reduce the stubble-burning pollution in those states. Secondly, we have told the commission that just ordering these governments is not enough.”She added, “The chief ministers of those states should be held responsible if any incident of stubble burning is noticed in those states. They should get strict punishment if they fail to ensure this. The commission has the power to take this action. It can file the FIR. It can send any person to jail for five years for causing pollution in Delhi and NCR. Therefore, we have urged the commission that the chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana should be held liable and strict action should be taken against them.”Atishi in her recent press conference has said that there is no official data to ascertain the proportional contribution of various factors to Delhi pollution. In a press conference held by Atishi on 15 March 2021, she quoted a report by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and said that 60 per cent of pollution in Delhi is caused by factors outside Delhi. In the same press conference, Atishi blamed the stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana for the air pollution in Delhi.In 2022, Bhagwant Mann of Aam Aadmi Party became the chief minister of Punjab. Since then, the attacks and accusations by AAP on Punjab and Haryana over stubble burning and the pollution in Delhi have suddenly disappeared. Now, AAP leader Atishi has said that there is no official data to encertain which source of pollution contributes how much to the Delhi pollution. AAP has government in both Delhi and Punjab. The AAP government in Delhi is saying that they cannot formulate a policy to reduce pollution because they do not have any specific data on the sources of pollution and their contribution into the problem. However, the AAP government in Punjab can take as many steps to prohibit the incidents of stubble burning and providing alternative ways of disposing the agro wastes to the farmers. But, AAP government in Punjab is not taking concrete steps to address the stubble burning issue in a way like what Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana has done in the past few years. Instead, the AAP government in Delhi had banned firecrackers in Delhi on the occasion of Hindu festival Diwali and had played with sentiments of Hindus in Delhi.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He denied being gay ""because he was a Muslim"" despite evidence showing that he engaged in sexual activity with at least one victimA 23-year-old Iraqi-Kurdish man has been sentenced to life for murdering two gay men in Ireland last year. Homophobic killer Yousef Palani brutally murdered two gay men last year, decapitating one of them, and assaulted a third man during a four-day killing spree in Sligo town.Palani admitted to the offences at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin on 23rd October and pleaded guilty to the murders of Adian Moffitt at Cartron Heights on 10th April 2022 and Michael Snee at City View on 12th April 2022.The accused also pleaded guilty to causing serious harm to Anthony Burke, a local man who survived Palani’s attack and assisted in the police investigation.Justice Mary Ellen Ring while delivering the sentence, said that Palani had committed “unspeakable violence” against three innocent men. Palani reportedly targeted gay Irish men who lived alone.He used a gay dating app to find his victims. He then tied them up before stabbing them to death and mutilating their bodies in their homes. Palani decapitated Adrian Moffitt, placed his head on a bed and his body was on the floor. Moffitt had 42 stab wounds, and his hands were tied behind his back.A yellow bottle of bleach was left beside his head, while a knife with a serrated blade had been placed into Mr Moffitt’s right hand after he was murdered.Michael Snee was also found tied up on the floor of his own bedroom, while a hunting knife and a black coloured knife had been laid on the bed to make the shape of a cross.There were 38 sharp force injuries to Snee’s body, and he had been stabbed 25 times mainly to the head, neck and chest, said the garda witness.Survivor Anthony Burke recalled Palani “shoving” a knife in his eye and said he was suffering insomnia, heightened anxiety, and mood deterioration since the attack. Burke lost sight in one eye.The gardai (police) said that Palani would have continued to kill gay men if he had not been arrested on 13th April. Palani reportedly told the police that he wasn’t gay because he was a Muslim despite forensic evidence showing that he engaged in sexual activity with at least one victim.Detective Conor Jordan said that there is no evidence that Palani was radicalised “despite some suggestions to the contrary”.Detective Jordan said that there is no evidence to support Palani’s claim of mental health issues. Palani had initially denied any involvement but later made full admissions claiming that he heard voices which told him to carry out the attacks.However, according to the detective, there is no evidence to support Palani’s claim of mental health issues and believes that his account of hearing voices may be exaggerated or fabricated entirely.Yousef Palani is originally from Iraq and had migrated to Ireland with his family when he was six years old under a UN protection programme. The family was provided with accommodation by the State in Sligo.Reports suggest that Palani and the family had strained ties with the neighbours. According to a report by Jihad Watch, a neighbour said, “It’s not that they were causing trouble all the time, but they would intimidate us subtly.”Another report by Irish Examiner claimed that when Palani played football with local children at 10-11 years of age, he would kick the children and not the football. This resulted in brawls between parents and reportedly “set the tone for future interactions”.The residents were quoted by the Irish Examiner saying, “We’re not racist. We just want the people to come and live here peacefully.”The report also claimed that Palani’s father was often seen doing karate moves in the middle of the entrance to the estate. He would run bare-chested around Cairns Hills every day – often backwards – even in winter and his wife would run after him with her niqab on.The father of the accused has reportedly not been seen publicly since his son’s arrest last year. No family member was seen at any of his court appearances at the Sligo District Court.Palani is known to be one to invite trouble even during his time in school. One of the locals said, “That guy Yousef was trouble from day one. And that’s a fact.” One of his teachers called him “extremely intellectually challenged”.Some neighbours also insist that Palani was known to the police. One of the neighbours reportedly witnessed him being arrested and taken out of the house in handcuffs over criminal damage allegations in the town.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

58,27-Oct-23,Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict: India considers sending second batch of weapons to Armenia in the face of rising tensions,"The decision comes after India successfully delivered the first batch of weapons to Armenia over the past year.Amid the ongoing Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, India is considering sending more military assistance to Armenia, its vital ally in the Caucasus, reports the Economic Times. This comes after India successfully delivered the first batch of weapons to Armenia over the past year.The article reported that India intends to send additional supplies some of which could consist of military hardware meant to strengthen Armenia’s deterrent might. The development came to light in the backdrop of serious tensions between Armenia and the Islamic country Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey and Pakistan.A top Armenian official recently was in Delhi to hold negotiations about the same, as per sources with knowledge of the situation. They asserted that India has emerged as a reliable source of weapons which is in line with their demand. However, specifics of the new shipments are undisclosed at this time and analysts in Armenia who want to remain anonymous stated that the cargo might comprise tools that could act as a deterrent amid the hostile environment with Azerbaijan.India’s previous consignment to Armenia included Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, rockets, and ammunition. The weapons were reportedly delivered through Iran, a country with historical ties to Armenia. Iran, which has historical ties to Armenia had reportedly facilitated the delivery. The supplies had prompted protests from Azerbaijan.India, Iran and Armenia established a trilateral earlier this year to explore a transit corridor. The three nations underlined the potential for strengthening cultural and people-to-people ties as well as trilateral collaboration in several areas during a meeting in Yerevan in April. They further spoke about economic initiatives and regional communication channels. The decision was made to “continue consultations” in the format at that point. The usage of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) as a regional connectivity network was addressed as well at the summit.Armenia has been acquiring Pinaka systems mostly because of Azerbaijan’s drone utilisation, as the system’s “shoot and scoot” functionality allows it to avoid counter-battery fire. It is also an excellent armament system for the country due to its affordability and ease of application. Due to their familiarity with the Russian-made GRAD system, the Armenian army could quickly become proficient with the technique. The head of Armenia’s parliamentary committee on defence and security affairs, Andranik Kocharyan recently declared without mentioning India that the new arsenal supplied to the country is now being tested by their military, with “very satisfactory” results.The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is an ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited mostly by ethnic Armenians until 2023.The small nation of Armenia is nestled between Turkey and Azerbaijan. The Azeris share Turkish culture and religion since they are ethnic Turks. The Ottoman Empire colonized the predominantly Christian Armenians for a very long period. Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia were the three Soviet republics that split apart from Armenia after the Soviet Union annexed the country in the 1920s.Armenia and Azerbaijan gained independence in the 1990s with the fall of the Soviet Union. However, a small area that was home to ethnic Armenians continued to be a part of Azerbaijan. The name of this area is Nagorno-Karabakh. In the 1990s, tensions rose, leading this region to announce independence with Armenia’s assistance. The impasse lasted for over thirty years until Azerbaijan unilaterally breached the truce in 2020, backed by Turkey.The dispute saw a significant escalation after this. Six weeks of intense combat were reported to have claimed thousands of lives. Azerbaijan took over large swaths of land, and by the time both sides agreed to sign a peace deal negotiated by Russia in November 2020, it had grabbed all of the regions surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh controlled by Armenia since 1994. The terms of the deal obliged Armenian troops to leave these territories and they have since been limited to a smaller part of the region.The violence was momentarily stopped by the arrival of Russian soldiers, however, tensions had been building for months between the two nations. In September this year, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia once again escalated as the Turkey-backed Azerbaijani forces launched a military offensive in the region. The onslaught that lasted for 24 hours claimed the lives of as many as 10 innocent civilians and left several injured.The following day, a cease-fire deal mediated by Russia was struck. The agreement stated that the military forces of Karabakh would be entirely disarmed and abolished.On September 20, the prime minister stated that Armenia was not a party to the deal, accusing Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan of attempting to draw Armenia into a confrontation. Amidst all this, over 1,20,000 ethnic Armenians living in the region started fleeing Muslim-majority Azerbaijan fearing persecution and ethnic cleansing by the Azeri authorities. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

59,27-Oct-23,Jamiat Ulema i Hind and Ayodhya case Muslim litigant insist on PM Modi inaugurating mosque after Ram Temple Pran Pratishtha for the sake of secularism,"""Modi is India's PM. He is for Hindus and Muslims both. If he is coming to inaugurate the 'ibadatgaah' (place of worship) of Hindu brothers, then he should also lay the foundation for the masjid,"" Mufti Hisbullah said.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to attend the pran pratishtha of the murti of Lord Ram in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in January next year, several Muslim leaders have now requested PM Modi to lay the foundation of the mosque in Dhannipur village when he visits Ayodhya on 22nd January 2024.Jamiat-i-Ulama Hind president at Ayodhya, Mufti Hisbullah Badshah Khan said that PM Modi is the prime minister of not just Hindus but also of the Muslim community in India. He asserted that when the prime minister is coming to inaugurate the temple of Hindus then he should also lay the foundation stone of the mosque.“Modi is India’s PM. He is for Hindus and Muslims both. If he is coming to inaugurate the ‘ibadatgaah’ (place of worship) of Hindu brothers, then he should also lay the foundation for the masjid,” Mufti Hisbullah said.Meanwhile, Athar Husain, the secretary of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation, the Ayodhya Masjid Trust said that the trust would welcome PM Modi if comes to lay the foundation stone of the mosque in Dhannipur village in Sohawal block nearly 20-25 km away from the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Temple.“We wanted to build a free cancer hospital, a mosque, a community kitchen and a research centre dedicated to Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah Faizabadi, the hero of the 1857 freedom struggle. The PM’s presence can serve our goal. We will welcome him,” Husain said.“Modi is not the PM of any particular community,” former Ayodhya litigant Iqbal Ansari stated. “He is doing everything for the temple; he should do the same for the masjid.”Ansari also expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of the mosque’s construction, stating that while Lord Ram’s idol is scheduled to be installed in the temple in January, the mosque’s foundation stone has yet to be laid. He further asserted that the trustees of the Ayodhya Masjid Trust should be replaced.Mohammad Ismail Ansari, President of the Indian Muslim League expressed his “heartfelt wish” to inaugurate the Dhannipur Mosque also. Essentially, the Muslim side’s insistance that PM Modi inaugurate a mosque after the Pran Pratishtha as well seems to stem out of their insistance that the Prime Minister has to prove his ‘secular’ credentials by inaugurating a mosque as well. Notably, on 25th October, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust formally invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the inauguration of Ram Mandir. The temple trust also announced that the consecration of the Shri Vigraha of Lord Shri Ramlala Sarkar at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya will be done by PM Modi on January 22 next year.As reported earlier, the Mandir trust has decided to commence the consecration of Ram Lalla after Makar Sankranti on January 14, and it will be followed by the 10-day ritual of ‘Pran Pratishtha’ (blessing) of Ram Lalla. According to the Chief Priest of Ram Mandir, Acharya Satyendra Das Ji Maharaj, the rituals will be held from January 15 to January 24.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The Mumbai LitFest’. He is set to participate in two sessions, which are scheduled to be held on Friday (27th October) and Saturday (28th October). Hasan will share the stage with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for an event titled ‘For the love of the Word- The Anil Dharker Session: Inauguration of Tata Literature Live! 2023 followed by in praise of the phrase.’He will participate in another session titled ‘Turn the Tide’ with ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai. The event will be held at ‘The Tata Theatre’, which is located inside the ‘The National Centre for the Performing Arts’ (NCPA) premises in South Mumbai.Today. In Mumbai. https://t.co/wGFi9HpvImThe website of ‘Tata Literature Live! The Mumbai LitFest’ describes the Hinduphobic ‘journalist’ as “the British-American host of The Mehdi Hasan Show on MSNBC and Peacock.” “He is the author of the New York Times bestseller Win Every Argument: The Art of Debating, Persuading, and Public Speaking. He is a former anchor for Al Jazeera English and has written for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Guardian, among other publications,” it further reads.The event is sponsored by Tata Steel, Tata Motors and is powered by the likes of Godrej and Kotak. The event has been hosted in association with ‘The National Centre for the Performing Arts’ (NCPA) .Hasan is infamous for his 2009 video where he was heard equating non-Muslims with ‘cattle’ and homosexuals with ‘paedophiles.’He was heard saying, “Once we lose the moral high ground we are no different from the rest, of the non-Muslims, from the rest of those human beings who live their lives as animals, bending any rule to fulfill any desire.”It must be mentioned that Mehdi Hasan is of Indian descent but was raised in England since childhood. Although he apologised for his remarks in 2019, it becomes clear that his upbringing in a diverse, multicultural society could not rid him of his disdain for non-Muslims.Gentle reminder that Mehdi Hasan has previously characterized non-Muslims as immoral people who “live their lives like animals,” and lumped homosexuals together with pedophiles and sexual deviants in his speeches: pic.twitter.com/ZX7b71EvSJIn April 2022, the MSNBC anchor went on a tirade against PM Modi and cast aspersions on India’s secularism.“Putin. Orban. Le Pen. We talk a lot in the West about the rise of far-right authoritarians and yet we never mention India’s Narendra Modi and his BJP. I did a deep-dive into India under Modi & new warnings of an anti-Muslim genocide,” Hasan claimed.In the video, he equated Hindu Nationalism in India (a nation that was divided on religious lines) with white Supremacy in the West, which is an ideology based on race. His sinister agenda was to equate Hindutva with Anti-Semitism.Putin. Orban. Le Pen.

61,27-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi returns from a ‘mysterious trip’ to Uzbekistan: List of his secret ‘foreign trips’, meetings with anti-India elements and calls for foreign interference","Rahul Gandhi’s foreign visits are always shrouded in mystery. Besides political speculations, there is often little to no news about his 'secret' travels abroad.On Friday (27th October) morning, Congress scion Rahul Gandhi returned to India from yet another ‘secret trip’ abroad. The development comes just months ahead of crucial Vidhan Sabha elections in several States.As per a report by ANI, Rahul Gandhi reached the Delhi International Airport from Uzbekistan on Friday morning. In a video shared by the news agency, the Congress MP could be seen exiting the airport and sitting in his convoy. #WATCH | Congress MP Rahul Gandhi arrives at Delhi Airport from Uzbekistan. pic.twitter.com/REDfNx48AiIt is notable here that Rahul Gandhi’s foreign visits are always shrouded in mystery. Besides political speculations, there is often little to no news about his foreign travels. The Congress scion has a history of going on vacations without informing the public during election season or at times when his party needs him the most.In April 2022, after poll strategist Prashant Kishor had rejected Congress’ offer to join the party, Rahul Gandhi became untraceable again. Reports mentioned that Gandhi went missing for over 10 days and had gone unreachable, leaving the party to act alone in action during the crisis.Earlier in December 2021, the Wayanad MP had gone for a personal trip to Italy ahead of the campaigns and rallies for then-upcoming Assembly elections in five states scheduled for 2022. He had forced the party to postpone his already scheduled rally in Punjab and had flown to Italy for a ‘personal visit’.Just before Diwali 2021, Rahul Gandhi vanished again, reportedly to London. On November 5 of that year, it was reported that Gandhi was on a ‘long vacation’.He returned after almost a month, just before the winter session commenced in the Parliament. At that time, the BJP took a dig at Gandhi and questioned his trip to London.In September 2021, while the Congress party in Punjab was facing a crisis with Amarinder Singh’s resignation, the Gandhi family was vacationing in Shimla.In December 2020, he left for Italy on the 136th foundation day of his party. His party leaders could not settle on one explanation and further made themselves a target of media questions. In October 2019, fifteen days before the assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra, Gandhi had left, reportedly for Bangkok. In June of that year, before the counting of votes of the parliamentary elections, Rahul Gandhi skipped an important meeting held by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and flew to London for a holiday. In November 2019, BJP leader Rajnath Singh quizzed Rahul Gandhi about his decision to not take Special Protection Group (SPG) personnel along with him on his foreign trips.“In the last two years, Rahul Gandhi was out for 72 days on six foreign trips, but didn’t take SPG cover. Why didn’t he take SPG cover? We want to know what Rahul Gandhi is trying to hide by not taking SPG along on foreign tours when he is a SPG protectee,” he had inquired.Such a deliberate move is reportedly a violation of the SPG Act. In light of repeated violations of security rules both in India and abroad, his SPG protection was revoked in 2019 and was provided Z+ CRPF security cover. Rahul Gandhi was on a 10-day USA tour, where he spoke at the National Press Club, Stanford University and also, to ‘think tanks’, allegedly discussing relations between India and USA. The Hudson Institute tweeted images of Rahul Gandhi in deep conversation with these “think tanks”. Sunita Vishwanath was seated alongside Rahul Gandhi at this event at Hudson Institute. Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of HrHR, which has also signed this letter against Narendra Modi alongside IAMC.Investigating Info-warfare and Psy-war OSINT Disinfo Lab had conducted an investigation revealing that the ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHR)’ had been promoting the misleading narrative of ‘Hindu Vs Hindutva’. The same organisation was also seen endorsing the ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva’ event. Hudson was honored to host @RahulGandhi to discuss the state of US-India relations and further cooperation between both nations. 🇺🇸🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/fIUJhS4ooXAs per Disinfo Lab, HfHR was formed in the year 2019 by two Islamist advocacy groups named Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) and the Organization for Minorities of India (OFMI). Interestingly, the three organisations had formed another outfit called the Alliance for Justice and Accountability (AJA).As per an article in The Hindu, the Alliance for Justice and Accountability had been at the forefront of leading demonstrations against the visit of PM Modi to Houston on September 22, 2019. According to Disinfo Lab, the co-founder of Hindus for Human Rights, Sunita Vishwanath, also runs an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by the Soros Open Society Foundation. Earlier, OpIndia reported in detail how George Soros had been fuelling a dangerous anti-India narrative through media and ‘civil society.’Prominent Indian politician Shri Rahul Gandhi, during his proposed #RahulInUSA tour,would attend several public events. He may not know, but some ‘coordinators’ who are claiming to be associated with events are Pak Jamaat-e-Islami & Muslim Brotherhood-linked frontsA Thread pic.twitter.com/pqaHO6n31LIn September this year, Rahul Gandhi was seen with anti-India Italian leftist politician Fabio Massimo Castaldo. Fabio Massimo Castaldo is the person in a red tie seen on the extreme right in the second photograph of the X post by the Congress party’s official X handle. Fabio Massimo Castaldo’s association with Pervaiz Iqbal Losar – an ISI asset in Europe – puts Rahul Gandhi’s intent to visit the European Parliament under suspicion. It is, therefore, necessary to know more about Fabio Massimo Castaldo and his alleged ISI friend Parvaiz Iqbal Losar.Fabio Massimo Castaldo is a former member of the European Parliament. The Italian leftist politician is friends with Pervaiz Iqbal Loser who is a Europe asset of the Pakistani spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Loser has been working to peddle anti-India propaganda on the Kashmir issue and lobbying against India’s interests in Europe. One of the old X posts by Fabio Massimo Castaldo is a testimony to this. Rahul Gandhi also met MEP Pierre Larrouturou during his September trip.MEP Pierre Larrouturou was one of the key figures behind the anti-India resolution passed in the EU parliament in July over the Manipur issue. In a long social media rant, Pierre Larrouturou even made it clear that the EU resolution was specifically timed to target PM Modi’s France visit.Pierre Larrouturou, representing the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, took the lead in proposing the resolution titled ‘India, the situation in Manipur’.Very honored to welcome @RahulGandhi to the European Parliament today 🇪🇺He is one of the great figures of Indian democracy and has been fighting for years against the ultra-nationalism of the Modi government.With MEPs from 7 different groups, we had a very interesting… pic.twitter.com/59GEvdKU7nAlviina Alametsa, who Rahul Gandhi met in Brussels, was also one of the MEPs who were behind the resolution. Alametsa has been a vocal anti-India campaigner in Europe. In January this year, she participated in a discussion with Prashant Bhushan and Shahrukh Alam, hosted by The London Story, an organization that has been linked to ISI.In July 2023, speaking in the EU plenary, Alametsa stated that external observers must be allowed into Manipur to ‘monitor’ the situation and bring a peaceful resolution. She claimed that the status of human rights and press freedom is deteriorating in India and called for interference in India’s internal affairs.My deepest condolences to those affected by the violence and human rights violations in Manipur. We must end the violence and find a peaceful resolution to the situation. Here is my complete address to the European Parliament on the situation. pic.twitter.com/bqtoXTw8CRAlviina Alametsa has been relentless in her campaigning against India, writing columns, lobbying, and campaigning against Indian interests in the EU. In January 2021, she wrote an article in the EU Observer calling for EU’s support for interfering in the ‘human rights’ situation in India.In her India-centric interactions and narrative, Alametsa has been using platforms to promote or support all anti-India voices, from Teesta Setalvad to Sanjiv Bhat, and Stan Swamy.The instances of Rahul Gandhi seeking ‘foreign help’ for his political gain in India are numerous. After losing election after election, failing to win the trust of the Indian people democratically, he has started declaring to global Leftists that India is a country deep in chaos, where democracy is declining and only he can restore it. In April 2021, speaking at Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, Gandhi insisted that the US government establishment should ‘say more’ about ‘what is happening in India.In 2022, at the ‘Ideas for India’ conference in the United Kingdom, Rahul Gandhi had sought foreign intervention again. During his controversial address, Rahul Gandhi signaled his desire for foreign intervention two times. Not only was Rahul Gandhi demanding foreign intervention into India & attacking our sovereignty on foreign soil but look at this now! Apparently he was sharing stage with Kamal Munir a Pakistani while he was undermining India & Indian institutions Shocking ! Congress must… https://t.co/XYwSIehzEC pic.twitter.com/ZmHsOyuPAOThe first one is during the mention of the Russia-Ukraine issue, and the second one is when he criticized Indian diplomats for being unwilling to take orders from Europeans. In the same conference, he had even compared Ladakh to Ukraine, insinuating that it needs a US intervention.Gandhi has also spoken at the Cambridge University. The Open Society Foundations (OSF) of Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros has been a member of the University of Cambridge’s Guild of Benefactors since 2013. The same George Soros pledged USD 1 Billion to change the regime in India. His foundation provides post-graduate scholarships in “programmes that represent a long-term response to ongoing social and political transformations in the countries served.”Soros has recently openly targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Adani Group.

62,27-Oct-23,"Uttarakhand’s Waqf properties to be brought under the RTI Act ensuring transparency, over 2,200 properties registered under Waqf: Details","According to the Waqf Act of 1995 (amended in 2013), the Uttarakhand Waqf Board is responsible for overseeing the Waqf properties. However, there has been a consistent lack of transparency in the system. As a result, the management of Waqf properties has avoided appointing public information officers. In Uttarakhand, the State Information Commission has included the Waqf Board under the Right to Information Act (RTI Act). With this, mosques, dargahs and madrasas will now have to give all the information about income and properties.Information about the status of Waqf properties worth billions of rupees in the state, their income-expenditure and how the process of work is being conducted will now be made public. Around 2,200 waqf properties are registered with the Uttarakhand Waqf Board.According to the Waqf Act of 1995 (amended in 2013), the Uttarakhand Waqf Board is responsible for overseeing the Waqf properties. However, there has been a consistent lack of transparency in the system. As a result, the management of Waqf properties has avoided appointing public information officers. Following the recent directive, this practice will no longer be continued.The issue of waqf properties being exempt from the Right to Information Act was brought to light following an RTI application submitted by advocate Danish Siddiqui, a resident of Nagar Panchayat Piran Kaliyar. In July 2022, Siddiqui requested information from the Uttarakhand Waqf Board regarding various activities at the Piran Kaliyar Dargah.In response, he was informed that there was no designated public information authority in Piran Kaliyar, thus preventing the release of information on the matter. As the situation persisted beyond the initial departmental appellate officer level, the case was eventually escalated to the Information Commission.During the appeal proceedings, State Information Commissioner Yogesh Bhatt sought a comprehensive explanation from the officials of the waqf board, emphasising the need for clarification on aspects such as the Waqf Act and the extent of control over waqf properties. Subsequently, it was established that all waqf properties are indeed under the purview of the board, and the chief executive officer is authorised to conduct inspections, and assessments, and obtain any necessary documents related to waqf properties. It was concluded that all waqf properties were under government authority.Information Commissioner Yogesh Bhatt also solicited responses from both former and current chief executive officers in relation to the case. Subsequently, directives were issued to bring the administration of the Piran Kaliyar Dargah within the ambit of the RTI Act. As a result, a Public Information Officer has been assigned to this role.Furthermore, mandates have been put in place to enforce the RTI Act across all other Waqf administrations. The Information Commission has mandated the formulation of a manual in accordance with Section 4 of the Right to Information Act within a span of six months. Additionally, there has been a call to establish a legal framework for the dissemination of information.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

63,27-Oct-23,"NIA court sentenced Syed Maqbool, one of the 11 accused in Indian Mujahideen case, to 10 years in prison, had planned explosive attacks in India","A resident of Maharashtra's Nanded, Maqbool was arrested in the case on February 28, 2013, for his active involvement with members of Indian Mujahideen based in Pakistan and India and involvement in the crime and conspiracy. A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Delhi on Thursday sentenced 10 years of imprisonment to Syed Maqbool, one of the accused in the Indian Mujahideen conspiracy case. Maqbool was previously convicted on September 22, 2023, by the special judge of the NIA special court in the national capital.

64,26-Oct-23,"Modi govt’s regional air connectivity scheme UDAN completes 6 successful years, 1.3 crore passengers carried, 499 routes operationalised","The Scheme will now allow operations on routes provided that at least one origin or destination is in a priority area and at least one origin or destination is a heliport, thereby enhancing the potential range of connectivity.The Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) – UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik), a government-backed initiative to improve infrastructure and connectivity in India, especially in remote and underserved regions, completed six years.It is a vital component of India’s National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) 2016, launched by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) on October 21, 2016, with a 10-year vision.The first RCS-UDAN flight was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 27, 2017, connecting Shimla to Delhi. The scheme focuses on improving unserved air routes in underserved regions of the country and fulfilling the aspirations of the common citizens, the Ministry of Civil Aviation stated.So far, RCS-UDAN has facilitated the travel of more than 130 lakh passengers, demonstrating its success in enhancing air travel accessibility.Meanwhile, over the period of 6 years, various versions of the UDAN Scheme were launched: UDAN 1.0: 5 airlines companies were awarded 128 flight routes to 70 airports (including 36 newly made operational airports), UDAN 2.0: 73 underserved and unserved airports were announced and for the first time, helipads were also connected, UDAN 3.0: In coordination with the Ministry of Tourism, Tourism Routes were included. In addition to Seaplanes for connecting Water Aerodromes, several routes in the North-East Region came under the ambit of the scheme and UDAN 4.0: Gave impetus to North-Eastern Regions, Hilly States, and Islands. The operation of helicopters and seaplanes incorporated, the Ministry stated.After the four successful rounds of bidding, the Ministry of Civil Aviation launched the 5th version of RCS-UDAN with numerous improvements based on stakeholder feedback.UDAN 5.0 where the focus is on Category-2 (20-80 seats) and Category-3 (>80 seats) aircraft. Similarly, the cap of 600 km has been removed and there is no restriction on the distance between the origin and destination of the flight. This round prioritizes the routes that will connect the airports that are ready for operations or will be ready soon, which will lead to quicker operationalization of awarded routes. Consequently, Airlines would now be required to commence operations within 4 months of the award of the route, and they are welcoming this change as this helps them to better plan their operations. Additionally, if the average quarterly PLF of the route, for four continuous quarters, is higher than 85 per cent, the exclusivity for that route would be withdrawn, allowing for other airlines to also provide connectivity on the route, it added.This was soon followed by UDAN 5.1, This round of RCS-UDAN is designed specifically for helicopter routes by increasing the scope of operations for helicopter operators, enhancing VGF and reducing Airfare Caps.The Scheme will now allow operations on routes provided that at least one origin or destination is in a priority area and at least one origin or destination is a heliport, thereby enhancing the potential range of connectivity. VGF caps have been enhanced to improve viability for operators and airfare caps have been reduced to make flying more affordable for passengers respectively.Currently, bidding for UDAN 5.2 is underway to further enhance the connectivity to remote and regional areas of the country, achieve last-mile connectivity, and provide impetus to the tourism sector through small aircraft (&lt;20 seats). The Scheme will provide greater operational flexibility to the small aircraft operators, by allowing them to operate a maximum of 40% of annually quoted RCS seats and a minimum of 10 per cent of annually quoted RCS seats in any given quarter, the Ministry said.The Ministry further said that RCS-UDAN is contributing to the growth of the civil aviation industry as four new and successful airlines have come up in the last 6 years. The scheme has helped airline operators to start up and develop a sustainable business model.Additionally, it’s providing opportunities to small regional airlines FlyBig, Star Air, and IndiaOne Air to scale up their businesses and their successful run is evidence of the fact that the scheme is creating an amiable ecosystem conducive to airline business.The scheme’s incremental expansion has generated an escalating demand for new aircraft, concurrently broadening the spectrum of aircraft deployed. This augmentation encompasses a comprehensive range of aircraft and encompasses helicopters, seaplanes, 3-seat propeller planes, and jet planes, it stated.Presently, a diversified fleet, including Airbus 320/321, Boeing 737, ATR 42 and 72, DHC Q400 and Twin Otter, Embraer 145 and 175, and Tecnam P2006T, is actively serving on the RCS routes.The heightened demand for aircraft is substantiated by Indian carriers’ orders, which exceed 1,000 aircraft slated for delivery over the next 10-15 years, representing a significant augmentation of India’s existing fleet, which currently comprises approximately 700 planes operated by various airlines, it said.RCS-UDAN is not solely dedicated to offering last-mile connectivity to tier-2 and tier-3 cities; it also stands as a prominent contributor to the burgeoning tourism sector. UDAN 3.0 introduced tourism routes connecting several destinations in the Northeast region, while UDAN 5.1 is dedicated to expanding helicopter services in hilly regions to stimulate tourism, hospitality, and local economic growth.This initiative has successfully connected destinations such as Khajuraho, Deoghar, Amritsar, and Kishangarh (Ajmer), which have substantial relevance in religious tourism. The entire Northeast region’s tourism industry is experiencing a considerable upsurge due to the introduction of Pasighat, Ziro, Hollongi, and Tezu airports, fostering greater accessibility, the Ministry said.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

65,26-Oct-23,Election Commission issues show cause notice to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for repeating already debunked lie that PM Modi donated ₹21 to Rajasthan temple,"It was already proven that PM Modi didn't use any envelope while making a donation at Devnarayan Temple in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, therefore the envelope that contained ₹21 was not donated by himThe Election Commission (EC) on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over her ‘envelop’ remarks in Rajasthan related to PM Modi’s temple visit. The notice has been issued under clause 2 of part I ‘General Conduct’ of the Model Code of Conduct for political parties and candidates, which prohibits criticism of opponents by invoking their private lives.The action by the poll panel came after the BJP filed a complaint with the EC alleging that Priyanka Gandhi had violated the Model Code of Conduct while addressing a public rally at Dausa in Rajasthan on October 20, 2023. In that meeting, Priyanka Gandhi said that she saw on TV that when an envelope of donation made by Modi at a Devnarayan temple was opened, it had only Rs 21. The BJP on Wednesday made a representation to the Election Commission of India and demanded action against Priyanka Gandhi, accusing her of “invoking the personal religious devotion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi” to make false claims during her poll campaign. “Today we met members of the Election Commission regarding a statement by Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on October 20 that violated the Model Code of Conduct and RP Act. We want to ask ECI if Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is above the Model Code of Conduct. We demand ECI to take action against her,” Law Minister Arjun Meghwal had said.Making the allegation which has already been proven false, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra added that she has seen the news and is not aware if the claim is true or not. She then used it to launch an attack on the BJP, saying that “envelopes” are shown to the public by the party but nothing is found in them after the elections.The notice says that the poll panel has received a complaint alleging that she made false statements in respect of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in her speech.The EC notice said that her statement was examined in light of the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and the speech has been found to be prima facie violative of the aforesaid provisions of MCC. The EC notice asks Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to respond by 5 PM on 30 October, showing cause why appropriate action for violation of Model Code of Conduct should not be taken against her.It is notable that the Model Code of Conduct has come into force with the announcement of poll dates in Rajasthan by the EC on 11 October. The allegations by Priyanka Vadra refer to comments by priest Hemraj Poswal of Devnarayan Temple in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, who claimed that when PM Modi had visited the temple in January this year, he had put an envelope in the donation, and later the envelope was found to have just ₹21. The priest had opened an envelope in front of the camera, claiming that it was the one put by PM Modi in the donation box in front of him. When he opened the envelope, ₹21 was found inside it.Several Congress leaders and others had used the video of the priest’s claim to attack PM Modi. Congress leader Dheeraj Gurjar even went on to claim that PM Modi “deceived” the Gurjar community as he offered merely Rs 21 in the donation box.However, it has been established that the entire claim by the priest was false, as visuals from PM Modi’s visit to the temple show that he didn’t use any envelope while putting money inside the donation box. PM Narendra Modi had put some cash in the box, without any envelope, and it is impossible to tell the amount as the cash donated in such donation boxes gets mixed.Priest Hemraj Poswal was present behind PM Modi when he had put cash without any envelope in the box, but despite that, he went on to claim that a white envelope was used by the PM. And Priyanka Gandhi Vadra repeated that lie in an election rally after the lie was already busted.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

66,26-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi and Satya Pal Malik vent frustration, peddle lies against Modi govt over Article 370, Pulwama, Farm agitation, MSP & more in 28-minute-long talk","Even though the discussion was nothing but brick-batting the Prime Minister, the uncivilised manner in which Satya Pal Malik spoke was unexpectedTalk about storm in a teacup and Rahul Gandhi’s interview/chat with former Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik begins with the message, “On 14th October, I had a conversation with former Governor of J&K, Shri Satya Pal Malik. Do you think the media will broadcast any of this?”One must commend Rahul Gandhi’s efforts to try to catch up with the times as far as content is concerned. But it is not fair for RaGa to take offence with the media for he leaves them dumbfounded. Still, if the media’s attention is what he wants, he must get it.In the 28 minutes 17 seconds-long conversation, the Gandhi scion and Malik touched upon several subjects including Article 370, Pulwama, Farmers, MSP, the Army, Bharat Jodo Yatra, Casteism, Demonetisation, and a new subject, “Liberal Hinduism”, whatever that is.At the centre of their conversation was venting their frustrations over Prime Minister Narendra Modi by making illogical statements, peddling lies, making bizarre insinuations, and sheer ignorance towards their own failures. As I said, a storm in a teacup.Surprisingly, Malik, whose political career spans decades, displayed Rahul Gandhi-level of political understanding of all these issues. Even though the discussion was nothing but brick-batting the Prime Minister, the uncivilised manner in which Satya Pal Malik spoke was unexpected. “Iski, kara raha tha, ” was how Malik addressed whenever talking about the PM. At the same time, Malik put up a great image as that of a loyalist of the Nehru-Gandhi Congress dynasty.In the same sentence, Satya Pal Malik appreciated and criticised Charan Singh saying, “Charan Singh ji was good. But his problem was that he had the dream of becoming the Prime Minister anyhow.” This prompted Rahul Gandhi to wonder why this is the case with politicians in India.“Many of our politicians have this issue that I have to become PM at any cost. By compromising everything, we want to become PM. Why does this happen that there is so much impatience that under any circumstance…Many politicians are like that,” RaGa asked ruminatively.For someone who has been launched, relaunched, and then relaunched again, we ask the same question to Rahul’s mother and former Congress President Sonia Gandhi. Why exactly do Sonia and her loyalists want to make RaGa PM when it was decided at least nine years ago, if not more, that it simply doesn’t seem to be working out?Meanwhile, it was an insinuation by Malik against the Prime Minister that pacified Rahul’s pondering mind. The interview cut out to the next topic after a RaGa-approved reply from Malik who said, “After independence, politics was like duty and people used to perform it like that. Then it became a profession. Now it has become a business.”According to Satya Pal Malik, Jammu and Kashmir “cannot be managed by force or the Army” and J&K’s statehood should be reinstated immediately. According to Malik, J&K was made a union territory because the government suspected that the police could revolt.What followed this bizarre statement was insinuation after insinuation to paint a picture that the Central government doubts the Jammu and Kashmir police. That a former Jammu and Kashmir Governor is pitting the Indian Army against the Jammu and Kashmir police shows just how many challenges India faces internally. Malik said that he had asked the government to reinstate statehood but, according to him, the Centre said that “that is not necessary, everything is going fine”, a point Malik disagrees with.“How is going fine? Insurgency is back. Terrorists are active,” said Malik and Rahul added to this saying that terror incidents have increased. These statements come merely three days after Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbagh Singh said that “terrorism is breathing its last in the union territory”.According to reports, Singh also said that only 10 local youth joined terror ranks this year as compared to 110 in 2022. This is reportedly the lowest number in the UT since late 1980s.In September, the J&K DGP had said that of the 49 terrorists neutralised by security forces in J&K, 40 were foreign nationals. And yet, the former J&K Governor damned official data to propagate his lies and help validate Rahul Gandhi. “It (terror incidents) is happening everywhere. Everyday something happens in Rajouri, Kashmir valley,” Malik said.At the very beginning, it is preposterous that Rahul Gandhi seeks Malik’s “opinion” about the Pulwama terrorist attack in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were martyred on 14th February 2019. Malik responds, almost doing a favour, saying that he won’t say that they (the government) got it done. Seems like Malik did take note of how his interview with Karan Thapar, where he held the Modi government responsible for the Pulwama attacks, was used by Pakistan media to give the terror nation a cleanchit.“But they ignored it in Pulwama and used it politically for themselves because there are his speeches (PM Modi’s) wherein he says that when you go to cast vote, remember the martyrs of Pulwama,” Malik told Rahul. He said that the Modi government wanted to use Pulwama for electoral gains to say that Pakistan did it and we will now defeat them.It is funny though that a little later in the conversation, Malik says that the Prime Minister called him at around 5-6 PM and asked what happened. Malik recalls saying to the PM, “I told him because of our mistake many of our people have died. He told me to stay quiet and not say anything on it.” He said the same was told to him by NSA Ajit Doval.Redirecting attention back to himself, Rahul alleged in the conversation that he was told by the security not to go to the airport to pay homage to the martyrs whose mortal remains were being brought to the airport.“They locked me in a room at the airport and told me “you cannot leave the room”. I asked them “what do you mean?” The martyrs were brought there, Army men were there. The Prime Minister was coming. And they literally locked me with a key and told me I cannot leave. I asked the security that how can they do this. I fought them and left from there,” Rahul alleged.Notably, this is the first time that Rahul Gandhi has mentioned this incident in all the times that he has spoken about Pulwama. Given that all of his claims have been proven wrong and that he has received backlash for politicising the attacks, Rahul seems to have spun this new story.Both Rahul and Malik called the tribute to martyrs at the airport “a show” with the latter saying that the Prime Minister should have gone to Srinagar. So the former J&K Governor is of the view that the right response from the PM should have been to visit Srinagar and direct all security to himself rather than ensuring safety and normalisation.With the security situation in J&K being extremely sensitive and local sentiments undecided, suggesting such experimental endeavours shows just why Satya Pal Malik is a failed politician who continued to lie in the course of the conversation.Malik parroted a lie that was first tweeted by Rahul Gandhi on 22nd February 2019, just eight days after the Pulwama attack. Malik said, “Jis din yeh hua toh yeh National Corbett Park mein shooting kara raha tha apni (The day this happened, he was getting his shooting done at Corbett Park).OpIndia had fact-checked Rahul Gandhi proving that the Prime Minister had completed his forest visit almost an hour before the attack in Pulwama, during which time some photographers took a few snaps of him. The photos were shared by Rahul with the allegations on Twitter and the same was spread like wildfire by his footmen in the Congress and mainstream media.Another big lie that Malik has peddled despite being fact-checked is that the Pulwama attacks happened because the CRPF were not granted the five aircraft which they had sought approval for from the Home Ministry.“Their application was lying at the Home Ministry for four months and it was rejected after four months. They had asked for five aircraft. It wasn’t given and the application was held for four months,” Malik lied.“Agar woh merese maangte toh main immediately kar deta. Mere saamne nahin aane diya. Agar mere saamne aayi hoti toh main kuch usme karta. That was between CRPF and the Home Ministry. (Had they asked me I would have granted. But they did not let me know about it because I would have done something about that. That was between CRPF and the Home Ministry),” Malik said.A report on 17th February 2019 quoted top CRPF officers and government sources saying that even if aircraft had been provided for personnel, convoy movement would still have happened as there were about 4,000 troops and aircraft could not have taken all of them.The CRPF officer said there was a backlog due to weather, and 4,000 personnel needed to be moved. Not all of them could have gone by aircraft.However, individuals like Satyapal Malik consistently spread fake news with help of the people like Rahul Gandhi, who has been… pic.twitter.com/5ey5M2luH0Staying true to his colours, not once did Malik condemn Pakistan-backed terrorism responsible for the several terrorist attacks including Pulwama. Rather his focus was to demotivate and demean Indian intel and the forces. Again drawing a divide between the Kashmir police and the Central forces, the former J&K Governor said, “Not one of the 8-10 link roads on the 10-km stretch where the attack happened was sanitised that day. When I used to send my Kashmir police, we used to halt civil traffic on the entire stretch and would send them after sanitising.” It is shocking that despite being proved wrong on several occassions over Pulwama, Rahul Gandhi was finding it tough to believe when Malik said that heaps of explosive had come from Pakistan.While Rahul decried that the media is reporting only on Israel and not furthering his political agendas, Malik placated him by saying that Rahul has stuck the Adani name to PM Modi which he cannot get rid of now. “People are also saying that Adani has his (PM’s) money,” Malik said. If you think this is funny, wait till you read the next best thing.“The day I did an interview with Karan Thapar, they called all channels and told them not to report it. And then Atiq Ahmed’s case happened and it was the headline for ten days,” Malik claimed.Rahul immediately, and excitedly, jumped in to say that he told his sister Priyanka Gandhi that Atiq Ahmed’s killing was done to distract the people from what you said about Pulwama. “I notied that when you spoke about Pulwama, they were scared,” Rahul stated.“But Atiq Ahmed’s news overshadowed it for 10 days,” Malik added. Yes, Satya Pal Malik thinks he is THAT important even after being ousted.It is still understandable to seek reservation/quota for a community in government ranks, but to ask for caste representation in all institutions, private or public is plain casteist. Rahul Gandhi claims to have found through his “research” that in all Indian institutions, including media and bureaucracy, OBCs, tribals, and Dalits have no representation. “Whether it’s a big media house or anchors, and reports they do not have even a single OBC, Dalit, or Tribal,” Rahul lamented. If Rahul Gandhi had it his way, he would introduce reservation in the media to ensure freedom of press. Who knows, the existence of leftist-laden Press Clubs might just start making sense what with new-found inclusivity and placards crying “Brahminical patriarchy” might not be needed anymore?After Rahul’s monologue on how the current Indian institutional structure and the system of information are preventing their voice from reaching the people because “Modiji turns up the loudspeaker”, Rahul took to the topic of the working class.He spoke about his conversation with carpenters who, he claims, told him that they build the products but they cannot go to the showrooms where the products are sold. “Our work, our labour, but the fruit is not ours,” Rahul cited them. Something tells me the message was beyond the realm of his understanding.Malik was quick to blame the Modi government for this. “It is so unfair, they hike prices, and publicise it. The poor don’t get anything. It is a very exploitative system.” I wonder if Rahul and Malik would be open to elaborating their views of this “exploitative system” if they were to have a casual conversation with a real economist.This was followed by a one-line attack on GST and Demonetisation each despite the fact that DeMo was announced targetting high-value currency, which by no logic can impact the poor. And then Rahul tossed the ball in Malik’s court mentioning farmers’ agitation. Malik was happy to receive it. Malik blamed the Modi government for the changing economic aspirations of the country and the rural youth increasingly venturing out to urban areas for employment opportunities. “Slowly, there will be no farming,” Malik predicted. Spare this writer for not being able to explain how and why the former J&K Governor immediately drew parallels between his imagination that “farming will end” the way “they finished Army” through Agniveer.Malik believes that “Who will sacrifice their lives for such a short period as Agniveer?” These are two daft Indian politicians, one seasoned in daftness, talking about what they think is right and wrong for the people of this country who they don’t even believe to have the patriotism it takes to safeguard the nation.Notably, a day before this mind-boggling interview, Agniveer Gawate Akshay Laxman was martyred in the line of duty in Siachen Glacier making him the first such casualty since the scheme was introduced last year. As for the “short period as Agniveer” that Malik has a problem with, Laxman will be accorded all honours as a “battle casualty”. Even in the Agniveer’s death, Rahul took the opportunity to target the forces. Here’s a fact check by OpIndia Hindi. Laxman’s family will receive Rs 48 lakh non-contributory insurance, ex gratia of Rs 44 lakh, Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer (30%), with an equal matching contribution by the government, and interest thereon. The Agniveer’s next of kin with also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death till the completion of four years which amounts to over Rs 13 lakh, and contribution of Rs 8 lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund, as per government sources. Here are all the facts you need to know about Agniveer.Rahul Gandhi then ranted saying that the Modi government is infiltrating its own people into every institution including the Election Commission (EC). This was Malik cue who alleged that Rahul should get a research done on how all Vice Chancellors in Central Universities appointed in the past one year are connected to the Sangh (RSS). Rahul’s understanding of this baseless and idiotic allegation is that the government is trying to practice “mind control”.Basically, this part of the conversation was about whining about every institution which Rahul Gandhi cannot get his hands on. One wonders why he did not mention the Opposition even once for that too is as good as an institution RaGa cannot seem to have any say or control on.Satya Pal Malik, while trying to explain to Rahul Gandhi what challenges the farmers are facing, said that farmers don’t know that they are becoming poor. He said that the gap between cost of the crop and fertilizer increases and reduces the farmers’ purchasing power year on year. “He doesn’t know that he is becoming poor.” Malik said that MSP should be implemented. But here’s the twist, MSP is already implemented. Oblivious to the fact, Malik went on to describe in detail why MSP should be implemented. He kept falsely accusing the government of cheating the farmers on MSP because Adani made big godowns and purchased crops at a set price. He alleged that the cost of these crops will increase next year and Adani will sell it.This very month, the Modi government announced an increase in the MSP of wheat by Rs 150, the highest hike in MSP prices since Narendra Modi became PM in 2014. In June this year, the Food Ministry informed that more than 830 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured at MSP benefitting 1.22 crore farmers.Rahul indulged in the conversation taking to his favourite part about Adani. He alleged that Adani has captured the entire storage infrastructure. “I saw its effect in J&K, in Himachal.” Malik responded by saying that the effect can be seen in Haryana and Punjab and in Panipat Adani has built huge godowns.The duo alleged that Adani has captured storage to “fine tune” and “increase and decrease” the prices. “This has directly harmed the farmers,” Rahul declared. The solution Malik gave to this imaginary problem was this, “Until and unless there is halla bol (attack) against them, they will not change.”“Or the government should change,” Malik said sowing the seeds of hope into Rahul’s barren head once again. “Aur 6 mahine ki baat hai, main likh ke de raha hoon, bilkul nahin aayenge power mein. (It is a matter of six more months. I give it to you in writing, they will not return to power),” Malik seals the deal in Rahul’s head.By this time, Rahul has switched from the role of an interviewer to being the guest and the guest, Satya Pal Malik, cheering RaGa on. Setting the argument that India is witnessing a clash between RSS and Gandhian ideologies, with the former being violent and latter peaceful, Rahul asks Malik about his views who coins the term “Liberal Hinduism”.“Only if the liberal Hindu thought is promoted only then will the country survive otherwise it will be divided(tuke-tuke ho jayega),” Malik said. Malik said that Gandhi and Congress vision should be promoted amongst the people explaining why they are different.Safe to say that when the Nehru-Gandhi loyalists could not insult the Hindu faith enough what with their attempts to separate “Hinduism” from “Hindutva” and what not, they are not trying to engineer the science of language and reinvent new narratives with the same old intention to malign Hindus.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

67,26-Oct-23,Pro-Hamas student organisation’s Toolkit exposes terrorist sympathisers in US universities,"The toolkit pointed out that the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel took place on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war, also known as the Yom Kippur War or Ramadan War or the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.On 24th October, Florida’s university system chancellor directed state universities to disband campus groups that have ties with the National Students for Justice in Palestine organisation. The step came after Governor Ron DeSantis issued a memo to the school leaders ordering them to crack down on the events held by the pro-Palestinian organisation. Earlier, Governor DeSantis had said in a statement had he been the President, he would have cancelled the visas and deported the foreign students who celebrated terrorism.When I’m President, if foreign students are out there celebrating terrorism, I will cancel their visas and send them home. pic.twitter.com/BPcVls2w7eDeSantis also called out the Biden administration for using the First Amendment and the idea of peaceful protest as an excuse for inaction against pro-Hamas protests at college campuses. Quoting NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby’s statement from 23rd October, DeSantis said, “The Biden Administration is dead wrong. No one has a right to come to our country. If foreign students are out there celebrating Hamas’ atrocities, they should have their visas cancelled and be deported.”The Biden Administration is dead wrong.No one has a right to come to our country. If foreign students are out there celebrating Hamas’ atrocities, they should have their visas canceled and be deported. pic.twitter.com/F29J6V7I6WThough DeSantis ordered a crackdown on National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP), the other states did not take any steps to stop the pro-Palestinian organisation from supporting Hamas terrorists.Activist Sarah L Gates shared a thread on X (formerly Twitter) with details about the organisation. Gates also linked a toolkit that NSJP released calling for nationwide protests at the universities in support of the Palestinian cause. While supporting the Palestinian people might not be wrong, the language used by the organisation was highly objectionable and clearly showed that they were supporting the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas.Whilst the Governor of Florida @RonDeSantis applied state laws to enforce closure of pro Palestine students groups involved with Hamas Al Aqsa flood national demos, other orgs and states who participated seem not to have the same laws or not to enforce them. 🧵 1/- pic.twitter.com/SYGrA1f3LsThe toolkit pointed out that the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel took place on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war, also known as the Yom Kippur War or Ramadan War or the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. The Hamas terror attack has been called “Toofan Al-Aqsa (Al-Aqsa Flood)” in the toolkit.NSJP referred to the Hamas terrorists as “Palestinian resistance” and the Israeli people as “Zionist settler society”. Completely ignoring the fact that the terrorists brutally murdered civilians, NSJP praised the Hamas terrorists for entering Israel and kept referring to it as “illegal Israeli settlements”. Interestingly, the organisation called out Israel for retaliation and claimed 320 Palestinians were killed by 12 PM ET on 8th October. “Despite this, our people choose resistance over negotiated cages on our homeland. Fearlessly, our people struggle for complete liberation and return,” the toolkit read.NSJP called it a “historic win” for the “Palestinian resistance” across land, air and sea. Calling for protests across the US, the toolkit read, “As the Palestinian student movement, we have an unshakable responsibility to join the call for mass mobilisation.” It added, “National liberation is near-glory to our resistance, to our martyrs, and to our steadfast people.”The group also called for “normalising the resistance” or seeing the Hamas terrorist attack as just “retaliation” by the people of Palestine. Furthermore, they categorically refused to see the Israelis as “civilians”. The toolkit read, “Settlers are not ‘civilians’ in the sense of the international law because they are military assets used to ensure continued control over stolen Palestinian land”.One of the most disturbing aspects of the protests called by the group was the use of a ‘paraglider’ as the logo for the protest poster. For those who are unaware, Hamas terrorists used paragliders to enter Israel and landed in the middle of a music festival with thousands of unaware and innocent festival-goers. They opened fire at them, killed them without caring about the nationality of the attendees, raped the women alongside dead bodies, abducted attendees and created unimaginable havoc. The poster is still available on the Instagram account of the group.In response to the call for the pro-Hamas protests, several student organisations came out. Here are a couple of tweets of such protests. @ The University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia 10-16-23 Peaceful protest.Pro #Palestine, Pro #Hamas vs Pro #Israel. pic.twitter.com/u1qixHe2wlUniversity of Washington Professor of Middle Eastern Dance participated in Pro Hamas protest yesterday. Protesters in video are chanting “Sacrifice our soul and blood for Palestine” in Arabic.I am so glad we have our @TPUSA professor watchlist to expose “professionals” like… pic.twitter.com/lqM1J0CjfVStudents for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is a network of student groups in the United States that uses inflammatory rhetoric and dissemination of anti-Israel propaganda in the name of advocating for the Palestinian cause. SJP has also initiated boycott, divestment and sanction (BDS) campaigns against Israel, which some view as counterproductive to finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict. SJP’s tactics include disrupting pro-Israel events and setting up symbolic “apartheid walls” to highlight the perceived mistreatment of Palestinians. The group also promotes “anti-normalisation,” which can hinder dialogue between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel advocates.Although some chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) claim to condemn anti-Semitism, they tend to vilify Jewish students who support Zionism or Israel. This creates a hostile environment on campus. SJP was established in 2001 at the University of California, Berkeley. Later, it unified under the Palestine Solidarity Movement (PSM) in 2006 with the support of American Muslims for Palestine (AMP). The National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) conference was established in 2011, and since then, SJP’s influence has grown. Some chapters hold more extremist views, including advocating for the dismantling of Israel, potentially endorsing violence, and rejecting dialogue with Jewish people.On 7th October, hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel through various means, overwhelming the Iron Dome with over 5,000 rockets in a matter of few minutes. They also abducted hostages and took them to Gaza. In a counterattack on Hamas by Israeli forces, thousands have been reportedly killed in the Israel-Hamas war. The death toll in Israel from the Hamas attack has now surpassed 1,400, with over 3,300 injured, primarily civilians. Israel launched a major offensive against Hamas in Gaza as over 400,000 Gaza residents were evacuated. India has launched its own Operation Ajay to evacuate Indians from Israel during this conflict.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

68,26-Oct-23,‘Deeply shocked’: MEA expresses concern as Qatar court awards death penalty to 8 ex-Indian navy officers,"In April this year, reports emerged revealing that there is a possibility of the ex-Indian Navy officers being “framed” by Pakistani intelligence agencies. On Thursday, October 26, the Court of First Instance of Qatar awarded a death sentence to the eight decorated ex-Indian Navy officers whom the Qatari intelligence service had arrested in Doha last year on charges of espionage. India’s Ministry of External Affairs has reacted strongly to the verdict saying that India is “deeply shocked.” MEA added that it would continue to extend all consular and legal assistance to secure the release of the eight former Indian Navy officers. “We are deeply shocked by the verdict of death penalty and are awaiting the detailed judgement. We are in touch with the family members and the legal team, and we are exploring all legal options. We attach high importance to this case, and have been following it closely. We will continue to extend all consular and legal assistance. We will also take up the verdict with Qatari authorities. Due to the confidential nature of proceedings of this case, it would not be appropriate to make any further comment at this juncture,” the statement by MEA read.It may be noted that since the eight former-Indian Navy officers were detained in August last year, their bail pleas have been rejected numerous times and their detention extended by Qatari authorities. The Qatari authorities had, however, until April this year, never specified the charges that had been pressed against them. Only recently did they confirm that the Indian Navy personnel, who were held in solitary confinement for long spells, have been charged with the offence of spying for Israel on the country’s advanced submarines.One of the jailed officers, Commander Purnendu Tiwari (Retd), is the managing director of the firm that was conferred the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award in 2019. The award was handed over by none other than the then-President Ram Nath Kovind. The other detained Indians are Navtej Singh Gill, Birendra Kumar Verma, Sugunakar Pakala, Sanjeev Gupta, Amit Nagpal, Rajesh Gopakumar, and Saurav Vashisht. The eight Indians were working with the Qatari Emiri Navy, on behalf of the Qatar firm Dahra Global Technologies and Consultancy Services which provided training and other technical assistance to them. The eight ex-Indian Navy officers were detained on August 30, 2022. The Qatari authorities reportedly accused them of spying for Israel on the country’s advanced submarines manufactured in Italy. These submarines are reportedly covered with metamaterials that enhance their stealth capabilities and make them harder to detect.In April this year, reports emerged revealing that there is a possibility of the ex-Indian Navy officers being “framed” by Pakistani intelligence agencies. According to reports, the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI had persuaded the Qataris that there may have been Indian participation by citing the case of former Indian navy commander Kulbhushan Yadav, who was kidnapped from Iran and detained in Pakistan on suspicion of spying.The Indian embassy, since the officers were detained by the Qatari authorities, has been making all possible efforts to bring them back. They have been facilitating regular visits to the family members and providing consular and legal assistance to the Navy personnel. Speaking of India’s position on the arrest of eight former Indian Navy personnel, MEA spokesperson Bagchi emphasised that the Centre was making “all efforts to assist these Indians.”Now, in the midst of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the MEA shared the shocking information that the Qatar court has awarded death sentences to these eight decorated ex-Indian Navy officers. India has, however, vowed to explore all available legal options to secure the release of its citizens.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

69,24-Oct-23,"Bhagwa Love Trap – a figment of Islamist imagination, created merely to harass Hindu men and counter real cases of Love Jihad, claiming lives of Hindu women","Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one's identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis. Love jihad is said to be a figment of the imagination of India’s ‘extreme Hindu religious organisations’. According to Indian media and a large intellectual elite, it is also regarded to be an Islamophobic conspiracy theory concocted by Hindutva ideology followers. They often dismiss it as a political ploy to polarise Hindu voters in support of the now-ruling BJP. Even a sizable portion of Hindus do not believe in the existence of Love Jihad. Despite all the outrage from both parts of society, both are often at odds when it comes to Hindu women eloping with Muslim men in huge numbers.The truth is that many Hindu cinema actors are married to Muslim men in the Indian film business. There is no controversy when renowned actors like Amir Khan, Shahrukh, Saif Ali Khan, and Kabir Khan marry Hindu women. Nawab Pataudi, Azharuddin, and Zahir Khan are all married to well-known Bollywood actresses. Indira Gandhi married Feroz Khan, and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain have Hindu spouses, yet no one has ever questioned it, and no one has ever termed it Love Jihad. Why? Consider following few examples: Case 1. In August 2014, national shooting champion Tara Shahdeo from Ranchi lodged an FIR citing her husband Ranjit Kumar Kohli alias Rakibul Hasan Khan in the national news headlines. Rakibul pretended to be Hindu and introduced his family as a Hindu household. Tara was exposed to his lies when Rakibul asked her to convert to Islam immediately after a marriage sermonised with Hindu tradition in a five-star hotel at Ranchi. Case 2. Sakshi, 16, was slaughtered by her purported lover on May 29 after she refused to continue their connection. Sakshi discovered that the 20-year-old man’s name was Mohammad Sahil, not Sunny. Sahil stabbed the woman numerous times before crushing her skull with a cement boulder in a gruesome murder. Images of Sahil wearing a Kalawa and Rudraksha mala had also emerged.Case 3.  In February 2023, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand’s holy city, Azhar Ahmed pretended to be Rahul in order to marry a Hindu lady, and after nine years of marriage, the victim discovered she was living with a Muslim man. The truth was revealed when she unintentionally discovered an Aadhaar Card at home. It included a picture of her spouse (Rahul), but the name given was Azhar Ahmad. Case 4.  This was December 2022 from Bihar’s Siwan area in which a Muslim guy pretended to be a Punjabi Hindu in order to snare a lady and then abandoned her to seduce another Hindu woman. The accused’s name was Kaleemulla, and he pretended to be Sameer Khanna. He converted the victim, Ratna, to Islam and changed her name to Ayesha Khatun. At the Hussain Ganj police station, a First Information Report (number 324/2022) was filed.Case 5. In July 2022, a case in which a lady, Rachna Solanki, made a police complaint against her husband, Amit Kumar Singh, who was actually Iqrar Qureshi. She discovered the truth nine years after their marriage. Iqrar had two Adhar Cards and his name was put as Amit Kumar on the wedding invitation. On June 18, 2022, the first information report (number 354/2022) was filed at the Jagdishpura police station in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. The pair performed Diwali puja and visited many temples together. Rachna claims to be a devout disciple of Lord Hanuman.Case 6. In June 2022, this case is from Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal area. Here, a woman doctor alleged that the accused, Nehal Khan, disguised as a Hindu in order to ensnare and sexually abuse her and that Nehal lived with her as if she were a Hindu. He accompanied her to temples and observed all rites and holidays. It was impossible for me to believe he was Muslim. Nehal began pressuring Priya to convert to Islam.Let us discuss the common feature in all of these cases: concealing one’s true identity in order to get close to a woman (or very often, a minor). Rakibul hides his identity as being Muslim to marry Tara. To entice the Hindu girl, Iqrar Qureshi disguised himself as Amit Kumar. Sahil Ahmad impersonates Sunny in order to lure Sakshi, marry her, and then murder her when she refuses to convert to Islam. Kallimulla disguised himself as Sameer Khanna to marry Ratna, but when he changed her name to Ayesha Khatun, only she realised it was a ruse. Every day, hundreds of incidents emerge from all around the nation in which Hindu, Christian, Jain, and Sikh females are being deliberately targeted to convert to Islam by this technic. In certain cases, Muslim men who have been captured with Hindu girls by Bajrang Dal activists have admitted to receiving training and money from particular Mosques or Madrassa for suspected Love Jihad, and the incentives are remitted while keeping the girl’s social and financial level in mind.This disguise as Hindu and concealment of Muslim identity in order to entice Hindu girls and women to marry and convert to Islam is known as “Love Jihad” and it is for real. Every day a section of the media is reporting such news of such cases of “Love Jihad.” Concealment of identity is not the only parameter, however. There are several other cases of forced conversion and violence too that have emerged, that fall under the ambit of Love Jihad. The accusation of love Jihad is not about two adults getting along after a courtship, working together, studying together, or even marrying each other where religious considerations are out in the open and anyone who insinuates otherwise is clearly trying to whitewash the criminal phenomenon. Love jihad is often referred to as a hate campaign by Indian intellectual militia. Efforts are being made to establish that it has connections with previous hate campaigns, present white nationalist conspiracy theories, Euro-American Islamophobia etc. It is, however, a well-known fact that Islamists are running this love jihad franchise as their flagship programme as organised and coordinated Jihad against Kafir women – the aims are simple – subjugation and conversion. Let us now discuss the purported “Bhagwa Love Trap” conspiracy theory by Muslim organisations in India. Since the Love Jihad module is in the public domain with the efforts of Hindu organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal etc., Muslim groups have started countering it with a fake narrative. Recently, Muslim scholar Shoeb Jamai accused Hindu organisations of creating Hindu boy’s clubs to seek Muslim females for marriage and conversion. They claimed to have seen a lot of Muslim women hanging out with Hindu men. They showed footage showing Burqa-clad ladies riding pillion on motorbikes with Hindu youths and attacking them, dubbed the “Bhagva Love Trap. According to a covert operation published by Opindia.com, several Islamists, who are part of the “Behen Beti Bachao” group made on social media which the Opindia reporter could sneak into, regularly share Pakistani propaganda content surrounding the “Bhagva Love Trap theory”. These include but are not limited to the inciteful and Hinduphobic videos created by a Pakistani YouTuber Ibne Kazi (screenshots of the WhatsApp chats are attached in the detailed article). The Islamist shared a leaflet, falsely claiming that 10 lakh Muslim women are being converted to Hinduism each year by the RSS as also claimed by Islamic cleric Nomani in his detailed speech. The propaganda-laden material also alleged the conversion and marriage of 800 Muslim women to Hindu men in Amaravati, Maharashtra. Based on reports and social media videos, OpIndia has compiled a total of 50 cases and posted the link on its website, where Hindu men and Muslim women were attacked by extremists under the pretext of the ‘Bhagva love trap.’ The attacks were carried out citing that a sinister plot was underway to convert Muslim women to Hinduism by luring them into a love trap – a conspiracy theory espoused by Sajjad Nomani in his multiple videos.Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one’s identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis.

70,23-Oct-23,The Hindu continues to peddle the North-South divide based on lies peddled by Communist Party leader and JNU prof: 15th Finance Commission report and the truth,"The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India as a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Just about 15 days back, The Hindu published an article on an imaginary North-South divide and we had given a detailed rebuttal to it. In the conclusion of that article, we had written that “It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too.”Looks like someone at The Hindu took this conclusion seriously and wanted to test if we would really repeatedly counter their repeated lies! And so, on the exact same topic, they publish yet another tripe on October 20th.  This time, they interview two known suspects – one is a former Finance minister from the Communist party (Thomas Issac) and another is a former professor from JNU (Balveer Arora). Thomas Issafc, who sadly was a Finance Minister once, opens his argument with an outright lie – that there are only two criteria defined by the Finance Commission on how to devolve funds to the States. We have repeatedly busted this lie but there just seems to be no end to the freedom that The Hindu and their ilk provide to these serial liars. The 15th Finance Commission has the following 6 criteria on which it decides how best to devolve the funds to the states in India. Income Distance and Population from the 2011 census are just 2 of those criteria. States that have done well on Forest and Ecology, Demographic performance and Tax Effort actually get rewarded better by the 15th Finance Commission – which is basically the key demand of these folks! It is intriguing to see this ilk assume that the people of this country will not have access to such basic information, and therefore they can simply publish lies and get away with it. The opening argument of the other interviewee, Balveer Aurora, is even more hilarious. In his infinite wisdom, he says – “if the population basis is being shifted from 1971 to a new figure, the weightage of the population can be adjusted. It is not written in stone that it has to remain the same”. Guess what – the weightage to the population in the 13th FC report was 25%. That report used the 1971 census as a reference (Yes, even for the period 2010 to 2015, we used the 1971 census as a reference!). The weightage to the population in the 15th FC report was 15%. That report used the 2011 census as a reference (Finally, the much-needed correction was made). So, when the population basis was shifted from 1971 to 2011, the weightage given only to the population had already been adjusted from 25% to 15%. How does the former Professor from a reputed university like JNU miss such basic information before making such banal arguments? After years of providing a platform for such hate mongers, The Hindu decides for the first time that they will ask a factual question on this subject – and hence pose the question to Thomas Issac:Thomas Issac goes on a verbal tirade that doesn’t answer the question. He continues to claim that “Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu” are at a loss. This argument that states are at a “loss” has been made by politicians from other states too. KCR’s son, KTR, for example, claims that while Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the central government, it only got back 1.68 lakh crores in return. He went to the extent of calling everyone who countered this fallacious argument “ignoramuses”. This set me thinking. In this particular example, the INR 3.68 lakh crores is the amount that people of India, specifically residing in Telangana, have paid as Tax directly to the Government of India. From this amount, a total of 1.78 lakh crore rupees have been transferred to the Government of Telangana, by the Government of India. KTR makes it sound like 3.68 lakh crores is the tax paid by the government of Telangana to the government of India. Thomas Issac also sounds similar in his arguments.Let’s for a moment just buy this argument. If Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the Government of India, how come only 1.78 lakh crores have come back to the government? Because this amount does not include the 1.08 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on roads in Telangana alone. It does not include the 1.58 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on procuring Paddy and Cotton from Telangana alone. It does not include the nearly 1 lakh crore spent on Infrastructure such as railways, power, energy, irrigation etc for Telangana alone. It does not include thousands of crores spent on welfare scheme beneficiaries in Telangana alone. A rough calculation pegs this amount to about 8.3 lakh crores! Am sure such similar numbers exist for Kerala too. The reason so many numbers for Telangana are known is that Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy released a detailed 320 slide presentation with all these numbers to counter the baseless arguments of KCR and his family. The moot point is that these divisive politicians and media are framing the debate in terms of a balance sheet of money alone. And in the garb of making an argument, they are simply falling back on the same lies again and again. The Hindu has been at the forefront of spreading these lies. Pompous editorials and Op-Eds questioning even the “constitutional propriety” of the 15th FC began back in 2018. In fact, this particular article even made the argument that the terms of reference for the 15th Finance Commission could have been silent on which population census to use. The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

71,20-Oct-23,"Amid the India-Canada standoff, India has, under the leadership of PM Modi, made it clear that we are no more a pushover nation","Besides India's stern approach towards Canada, it's neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's strong retaliation to China's Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by. On Friday, October 20, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their families from India. The move came after India gave an ultimatum for revoking the diplomatic immunity of those diplomats who stayed back post-10th of October even after being told to leave.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada nose-dived after Canada prematurely expelled an Indian diplomat on the 19th of September following baseless allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India went on to promptly expel a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat response to Ottawa’s expulsion of an Indian official over the case. New Delhi also suspended visa services for Canadian nationals.The chill in relations between the two countries was even evident at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10, so much so that even local Canadian media chastised its Prime Minister for being overlooked by Indian and other foreign leaders during the G20 Summit.As the bilateral relations between Canada and India worsen, several reports suggest that Canada has been desperately trying to diffuse the diplomatic row with India. India, on its part, has made it clear that it is no longer a pushover nation and would not tolerate acts of aggression, hate, and intimidation from the rest of the world. The Western big powers like the US, Russia and the UK have also when it came to the India-Canada standoff, chosen to steer clear of strongly-worded public statements that would antagonise India, fearing diplomatic backlash from one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and regarded as a potential counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. This is why, when the Canadian Prime Minister sought the support of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, to raise the issue with India he was snubbed by everyone fearing diplomatic backlash from India.The USA, which has a habit of interfering in every nation’s domestic affairs, was also compelled to toe a fine diplomatic line when it came to the India-Canada standoff. While avoiding offending Canada, one of its closest allies, it did not dare to oppose India. This is primarily because, India, in recent years, has advanced to a position where it is seen as a crucial defence partner for the United States and an essential counterweight to China.The West, including Canada, also has other major things to consider when it comes to India, including strong defence and trade ties that both sides would rather see maintained and strengthened.Another major reason why the Western nations haven’t taken sides may be that they are aware that India’s demand for parity in mutual diplomatic presence does not violate any international rules. In fact, when Canada accused India of flouting the Vienna Convention in withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 41 Canadian diplomats, India strongly responded to Canada’s statement on the withdrawal of some of its diplomats following India’s prod and said no international norm was violated seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. Basically, the Canadian presence in India is much more than India’s presence in Canada. Therefore, India has asked Canada to take back the excess diplomats so that it is equal to Indian diplomats in Canada.Moreover, the West is also completely aware that India is well aware that it has the upper hand and that, if it chooses, it can turn the faucet off and hurt Canada where it hurts the most.The majority of overseas students studying in Canada are from India. According to statistics provided by the Canadian government, around 40% of the 8 lakh international students studying in Canada at the moment are from India. Indian students pay three to five times more in tuition than Canadians do at private colleges. In a sense, Indians support the entire Canadian private college ecosystem, which will disintegrate if the Indian government decides to stop the outflow. Moreover, as many as 600 Canadian companies, including Bombardier and SNC Lavalin, have a strong presence in India, while more than 30 Indian companies, such as infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro have invested billions of dollars in Canada, creating thousands of jobs.The above multiple reasons might have also compelled Canada to change its rhetorics. On Tuesday, October 17, Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly indicated that they did not want to fuel tensions with India by speaking about them publicly — a sharp contrast with the open claims against India that the prime minister made in parliament.It is, however, not just in reference to how India has been handling the India-Canada standoff but there are other recent bold decisions India has taken under the leadership of PM Modi like maintaining a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India’s strong retaliation to China’s Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that India has a mind of its own and that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by.When Modi initially took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, nobody anticipated this three-time Chief Minister of Gujarat and outsider to Lutyens’ Delhi would become the nation’s top diplomat and steer foreign affairs like a gifted artist. But like in other areas, PM Modi took the initiative and crafted a new multi-dimensional foreign policy of multiple allegiances and issue-based allegiances, which has elevated India to the position of most sought-after partner on the international stage. After all, who could hug two arch-rivals- US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin with the same panache?It is difficult to think of another world leader who could tell Putin directly that this is “not the age of war,” and also persuade his foreign minister S Jaishankar to tell the arrogant West that “Europe’s problems are not the world’s problems,” while yet managing to maintain good relations with both sides.The West actually fought tooth and nail to have us on their side during the Russia-Ukraine war. India was under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a position. Despite the pressure, India resisted giving in. India remained impartial in regard to the situation between Russia and Ukraine despite pressure from the West.India’s toughness in its attitude was warmly received by the West, which was demonstrated by the fact that despite their differences, the U.S. and India have continued to have a strong collaboration in areas such as business, technology, security, and education.In June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley. The clash was the worst fighting in over four decades and resulted in severe casualties on both sides. The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was the first time Indian Army personnel were killed on the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.China, still celebrating its victory in 1962, blatantly misjudged India’s resolve to oppose its land-grabbing strategies this time. Beijing was shocked when the Modi administration chose to protect India’s frontiers.At first, India and China had multiple rounds of discussions, both officially in Delhi and Beijing and at the level of military commanders on the LAC. However, when it became clear that China would not back down, India made the decision to establish trade limitations on Chinese investors and goods.The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Modi, authorized the Indian Army to respond to any further escalation on the front lines in a responsible manner. An example of this was the aggressive occupation of specific heights by Indian troops near the Pangong Tso on August 5, 2020, which caught China off guard.With its handling of China’s Galwan misadventure, India once again demonstrated to the world that it is no longer a nation to be taken lightly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

73,17-Oct-23,Promotion of Tribal Cultural Heritage and its importance to decolonisation and nation building: How the Modi govt has taken strides in this direction,"The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.India is home to a diverse array of tribal communities, each with its distinct languages, customs, and traditions, contributing to the rich cultural tapestry of the nation. These indigenous tribes have inhabited India’s forests, hills, and plains for centuries, maintaining a harmonious relationship with nature and embodying a unique way of life. With a deep-rooted connection to their ancestral lands, tribal societies often exhibit close-knit communal structures and practices that have evolved over generations. The tribes of India possess an invaluable repository of traditional knowledge, encompassing everything from herbal medicine and sustainable farming practices to intricate craftsmanship and artistry. Despite modern advancements, preserving the traditions and well-being of India’s tribes remains crucial for maintaining cultural diversity and ensuring the equitable development of the nation. As Padma Vibhushan Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, the main architect of India’s Green Revolution, once said“One of India’s major blessings is the rich store of experience and knowledge available in the rural and tribal areas.”There are some unique indigenous tribal cultural dimensions in India that are not found anywhere else in the world. The Kattunayakan tribe in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India has a unique tradition of honey hunting. They follow ancient rock paintings that depict honey collection methods, utilizing a remarkable symbiotic relationship with local bees to gather honey. The Tangkhul Naga tribe in Manipur celebrates a distinctive festival called Lui-Ngai-Ni, where men demonstrate their strength by pulling huge stone slabs across the village. This ritual reflects their cultural heritage and emphasizes community bonding. The Mishing tribe of Assam practices a unique form of pottery known as Ali Aye Ligang. During this traditional festival, women create intricate clay pots using distinct patterns, symbolizing fertility, prosperity, and the tribe’s cultural identity. The Warli tribe, residing in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, is renowned for its tribal art characterized by simplistic geometric shapes and patterns. This traditional art form, often used to depict daily life and rituals, has gained global recognition for its distinctive style. As an environmental activist and ecofeminist, Dr. Vandana Shiva once said,“The heartbeat of our land is echoed in the rhythms of Adivasi cultures, enriching our diversity and teaching us the value of unity.”Since coming into power in 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has emphasized the preservation and revitalization of India’s diverse cultural heritage, including the rich traditions of its tribal communities. Through various initiatives and policies, the government has aimed to foster a cultural resurgence that recognizes the importance of tribal identity, traditions, and customs. One of the premier initiatives to celebrate and showcase India’s tribal heritage is the Aadi Mahotsav, started in 2017 by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs and the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED).  It gives indigenous communities the opportunity to showcase tribal products and help artisans connect with the mainstream population at the National Tribal Crafts Expo. In 2023, more than one thousand tribal artisans and artists from 28 states and union territories participated in the festival. The Modi government introduced the Van Dhan Yojana, which focuses on enhancing tribal livelihoods through value addition to forest produce. This policy empowers tribal communities by providing them with training, technology, and market access to develop and market their traditional products, thereby preserving their cultural practices. The government established the Eklavya Model Residential Schools to provide quality education to tribal children while respecting their cultural sensitivities. These schools offer a curriculum that combines mainstream education with the preservation of tribal languages, traditions, and knowledge. The government has actively implemented the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA), allowing tribal communities greater control over local governance and natural resources. This policy safeguards their cultural heritage by recognizing their authority over land, resources, and decision-making processes. This government also elected to the seat of the President of India Shrimati Draupadi Murmu, who belongs to the Adivasi Santal community, in a move that truly showed that we are on the path towards decolonization and embracing our indigenous heritage and roots with sincerity and integrity. She once famously said,“It is a tribute to the power of our democracy that a daughter born in a poor house in a remote tribal area can reach the highest constitutional position in India. And it is a matter of great satisfaction for me that those who have been deprived for centuries and those who have been denied the benefits of development, those poor, downtrodden, backwards and tribals are seeing their reflection in me. From Santhal revolution, Paika revolution to Kol revolution and Bhil revolution, all these revolutions had strengthened the tribal contribution in the freedom struggle. I am happy that many museums are being built across the country dedicated to the role of the tribal communities in our freedom struggle. I was born in that tribal tradition which has lived in harmony with nature for thousands of years.”With 2023 being observed as the International Year of Millets, the Union government has laid emphasis on the importance of millets in the tribal areas of the country. Millets are often called `Shree Anna’ which means `the honoured grain’ or `the mother of all grains’. Mahatma Gandhi once said: “In the richness of millets, we rediscover ancient wisdom and modern sustenance, a testament to the resilience of traditional crops.” An interesting case of how governmental intervention has helped with the resurgence of consumption of Shree Anna in rural India is the Korku tribe of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, which had a nutritional downslide in the 1970s when they rapidly moved away from millets to soybean and wheat, leading to malnutrition and worsening health conditions. With interventions such as the formation of Farmer Producer Organizations, the establishment of Centers of Excellence and seed hubs for Shree Anna (supported under the National Food Security Mission), tribes like the Korku have slowly started to move back towards their traditional food practices. Tribal millets like Kodo (Paspalum Scrobiculatum), Kutki (little millet) and Sawa (Indian barnyard millet) are seeing the light of day in a big way again. You may ask how food can be a part of the cultural heritage of a people. Well, food habits are a basic part of a culture that also serves as a point of emotional association, a channel of bonding or discrimination, while having symbolic references. Millets have been identified as foxtail millet (Priyangava – प्रियंगव), Barnyard millet (Anaava – अनाव), and black finger millet (Shyaamaka – श्यामक) in some of the oldest Yajurveda writings from India. The Yimchunger Nagas of Nagaland celebrate the Metumniu festival in August after harvesting millet crops. People in Vishakhapatnam’s tribal communities celebrate the Mandukiya festival in June-July each year, where bullocks are fed ragi-based food items. After observing Deepotsav (Diwali) or on the sacred day of Nagula Chavithi, it is customary to have ragi pancakes or other recipes. Madiah (ragi), along with turmeric, is still smeared on the bride and groom’s body during wedding rites in Madhya Pradesh. In tribal societies, millet seeds are believed to provide protection against evil spirits. To ensure successful hunting and a plentiful harvest, the Pahadi Korwa tribe of Chhattisgarh hang millet stalks in their courtyards.Post-Independence, the documentation of tribal practices in India faced challenges stemming from a lack of dedicated efforts, resulting in the loss of invaluable cultural knowledge as traditional practices faded away undocumented. Historical biases and a focus on mainstream narratives often marginalized tribal communities, leading to inadequate representation and documentation of their unique cultural practices, languages, and rituals. The absence of standardized methodologies and insufficient collaboration between academic researchers and tribal communities hindered comprehensive documentation, limiting the preservation and understanding of India’s diverse tribal heritage. What we often forget when observing and documenting tribal cultural practices is that more often than not it is us who have to learn a lot from them, as put forth by Jaipal Singh Munda, a member of the Constituent Assembly, in the context of democracy as a socio-cultural and political thought,“You can’t teach democracy to tribals. You need to learn democratic values from them. They are the most democratic community on earth.”The Modi government initiated a comprehensive documentation effort to record endangered tribal cultural practices, languages, and rituals. This policy aims to create a repository of knowledge that can be preserved, studied, and shared to prevent the loss of valuable traditions. The comprehensive documentation effort initiated by the Modi government involves ethnographic research teams collaborating with tribal communities to meticulously record and document endangered cultural practices, encompassing rituals, ceremonies, linguistic nuances, and traditional ecological knowledge. This initiative employs modern technologies such as audiovisual recording, digital archiving, and geospatial mapping to create an accessible and comprehensive repository, ensuring the preservation of endangered tribal cultural practices for academic study, community reference, and future revival efforts. There is still ongoing debate and discussion on whether utilizing remote sensing technologies such as drones and satellite imagery for non-intrusive documentation of tribal culture in India is a possible approach, given international examples such as from Guyana, where members of the Wapichan tribe use Parrot Bebop quadcopters for documenting preservation of important cultural and sacred sites to monitoring land-use patterns. The documentation effort by the Modi government also encompasses partnerships with anthropologists, linguists, and cultural experts, who work alongside tribal members to ensure accurate representation and culturally sensitive portrayal, safeguarding the integrity of the recorded practices while fostering a deeper understanding of tribal heritage. This work has also been facilitated by the `double engine model’ with state governments in BJP-run states such as in Goa, where the Tribal Research Institute was registered under the Societies Registration Act 1860 in January 2023 for better documentation and showcasing of tribal culture in Goa.Under the aegis of the BJP government’s Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program, a targeted funding framework was established, channelling resources directly to tribal communities for the documentation, preservation, and revitalization of their endangered cultural traditions. Through this mechanism, tribal groups are invited to submit comprehensive project proposals, outlining specific cultural practices targeted for revival, proposed methodologies, and anticipated outcomes, thus ensuring a focused and strategic approach. The funding allocation process involves an interdisciplinary review panel comprising cultural experts, anthropologists, linguists, and tribal representatives, who evaluate proposals based on criteria such as cultural significance, potential impact, community engagement, and sustainability. Upon approval, the granted funds are disbursed in phases, contingent on achieving predefined milestones, as outlined in the project proposal. This phased disbursement structure promotes accountability, effective resource utilization, and progress tracking. Even the Tribal Sub-Plan, which came into existence in the 1970s for developing areas with tribal concentration, was functional mainly as an accounting exercise without adequate emphasis on the planning and execution of schemes to ensure demonstrable benefits for the scheduled tribes, for decades! The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program allocated a budget of ₹500 crores during its first phase to support various projects aimed at documenting, preserving, and reviving endangered tribal cultural practices. Under this program, over 2,000 traditional tribal festivals and cultural events have been financially supported and promoted, facilitating the preservation and celebration of indigenous rituals and traditions across different tribal communities. The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program has facilitated the establishment of more than 300 Tribal Heritage Conservation Centers across the country, providing resources, technical expertise, and training to tribal communities for the documentation, archiving, and promotion of their cultural practices, languages, and traditions. In addition to financial support, the BJP government has organized capacity-building workshops, technical training, and access to modern tools such as digitization equipment and archival software, empowering tribal communities to execute their revival initiatives efficiently while integrating modern documentation techniques. On the occasion of the Tiranga Utsav on 2 August 2022, Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah released a pictorial book in memory of revolutionary tribal fighters of the Indian freedom struggle in partnership with Amar Chitra Katha.The Modi government has facilitated cultural exchange programs and workshops that bring together different tribal communities to share and learn from each other’s endangered cultural practices. These interactions contribute to the revitalization and cross-pollination of tribal customs. The Union government facilitated a series of cultural exchange workshops, engaging tribal artists and artisans from various regions, allowing them to share and exchange their unique cultural practices, craftsmanship, and traditional knowledge. This was beautifully encapsulated in the words of Indian playwright Mahesh Elkunchwar“Adivasi heritage is a tapestry woven with threads of resilience, wisdom, and cultural diversity that enrich the fabric of our nation.”It has also promoted the work of the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and organised the Tribal Youth Exchange Programme for the development of tribal youth with the support of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The aim of this programme is to provide an opportunity to the tribal youth of 30 selected districts of seven states to visit various places within the country to understand the cultural ethos, language and lifestyles of the people. One key aim of the initiative is to sensitize the tribal youth about their rich traditional & cultural heritage and enable them to preserve it for future generations. This is in conjunction with other existing initiatives such as the Ice Stupa Project Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (Government of India), because of which villagers were able to conserve around 75 lakh litres of water in Ice-Stupas during winters and undertake eco-tourism activities like first Ladakh Ice Climbing Festival that gave the local youth an opportunity to be part of eco-entrepreneurial ventures. The Going Online as Leaders (GOAL) Program, a collaborative effort between Facebook and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA), was inaugurated on May 15, 2020, with the ambitious goal of digitally empowering 5,000 youth from tribal communities in India. By enlisting the expertise of 2500 industry leaders and influencers across diverse fields, the initiative aims to provide personalized mentorship to tribal youth, focusing on digital literacy, life skills, leadership, entrepreneurship, and sector-specific expertise. The comprehensive nine-month program encompasses mentorship, skill-building, and practical experience through a two-month internship, fostering holistic development among tribal mentees. There is also governmental emphasis on intergenerational knowledge transfer within tribal communities, with encouragement given to elders to actively teach younger members about endangered practices, ensuring their continuity and relevance.The Modi government has displayed a strong commitment to the conservation and promotion of tribal languages through a series of targeted initiatives. As part of the ‘Eklavya Model Residential Schools‘ program, launched in 2018, over 460 tribal languages are being preserved and taught, ensuring that indigenous linguistic diversity thrives within the formal education system. Furthermore, the ‘Tribal Language Development Program‘, introduced in 2016, focuses on documenting and revitalizing endangered tribal languages. Through this program, a substantial corpus of tribal language resources, including grammatical structures, dictionaries, and literature, has been compiled. Notably, the government’s ‘Bhasha Sangam’ initiative has celebrated linguistic diversity by featuring over 100 tribal languages on digital platforms, fostering greater recognition and appreciation of tribal linguistic heritage. By embracing digital technology, the Modi government has also launched the ‘Tribes India E-Marketplace,’ facilitating the online promotion and sale of tribal literature, art, and crafts, including works reflecting the linguistic nuances of tribal communities. These comprehensive efforts underscore the government’s dedication to preserving and nurturing the linguistic identities of India’s tribal populations. According to the NEP 2020 report, approximately 220 languages have been lost over the previous 50 years. In addition, 197 Indian languages have been listed as endangered by UNESCO. Even certain official languages included in the Indian Constitution’s Eighth Schedule face significant challenges. A facile bureaucratic procedure sometimes serves as a vehicle for the extermination of a language or dialect. The Criminal Tribes Act was enacted by the British Indian government in 1871 and only repealed in 1952. The Act stigmatised and forced some populations, usually nomadic, to hide their cultural heritage and suppress their languages. Following the 1971 Census, the Indian government declared that any indigenous language spoken by less than 10,000 people would be removed from the list of the country’s official tongues. The dialects which have been considered endangered, include seven from Manipur (Langrong, Aka, Koiren, Aimol, Lamgang, Tarao and Purum), three from Odisha (Manda, Parji and Pengo), two from Assam (Tai Nora and Tai Rong), two from Karnataka (Koraga and Kuruba), two from Arunachal Pradesh (Mra and Na), two from Andhra Pradesh (Gadaba and Naiki), one from Uttarakhand (Bangani), one from Maharashtra (Nihali), one from Jharkhand (Birhor), one from Meghalaya (Ruga), one from West Bengal (Toto), two from Tamil Nadu (Kota and Toda) and four from Himachal Pradesh (Baghati, Handuri, Pangvali and Sirmaudi). Languages such as Ghallu, Helgo, Adhuni, Dichi and Katagi have gone extinct. The Union government under the leadership of Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan has initiated a Scheme for the Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India in December 2021 and been working with the Mysuru-based Central Institute of India Languages on the protection, preservation and documentation of all Indian language.The Union government has sanctioned over ₹864 lakh to various universities, institutes and academies for research on tribal medicinal practices and healing traditions nationwide, with the government data revealing that over ₹312 lakh has been allotted to the Patanjali Research Institute in Haridwar. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, operating under the AYUSH ministry, has undertaken a commendable Tribal Health Care Research Programme aimed at documenting and preserving the wealth of folk medicines and traditional practices present across diverse regions of India. Implemented through 16 peripheral institutes across the country, Tribal Health Care Research Programme not only collects valuable information but also extends healthcare services to tribal populations. Collaborative efforts with institutes like Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh and Bangalore in Karnataka involve comprehensive medico-ethno botanical surveys, meticulously cataloguing medicinal flora and indigenous practices. The National Medicinal Plants Board, under its scheme, has similarly sponsored ethnobotanical research projects in states like Assam, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, delving into the medicinal usage of local flora by tribal communities. The National Medicinal Plants Board’s creation of an accessible database, detailing the therapeutic attributes and habitats of over 7,000 medicinal plant species, stands as a significant resource for preserving and sharing traditional knowledge. Collaborating with CSIR, the Ministry of AYUSH established the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, a comprehensive repository of codified texts translated into multiple languages, serving as a preventive measure against the misappropriation of India’s traditional medicinal wisdom. Furthering these efforts, the establishment of the North Eastern Institute of Folk Medicine in Arunachal Pradesh aims to safeguard and promote the rich tapestry of folk medicine practices unique to the North Eastern Region. These endeavours collectively reflect a profound commitment by the Indian government to uphold and propagate traditional healing practices while ensuring their rightful recognition and protection. The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved the establishment of the National Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh as an autonomous organization under the Ministry of AYUSH in November 2019. Sowa-Rigpa, a traditional medical system indigenous to the Himalayan region, has found widespread popularity and practice in various Indian locales, including Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Darjeeling (West Bengal), Himachal Pradesh, and the Union Territory of Ladakh, now extending its influence throughout the entire country.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP government has made significant strides in promoting tribal cultural resurgence in India. Through various policies and initiatives, the government has recognized and empowered tribal communities, encouraged the revival of traditional arts and crafts, preserved tribal languages, promoted festivals, improved educational facilities, and safeguarded tribal medicinal knowledge. The efforts made by the government have not only preserved the cultural diversity of India but also empowered tribal communities to actively participate in the nation’s growth and development. However, there is still much to be done to ensure that the tribal cultural heritage remains vibrant and thriving for future generations. It is imperative for the government and society as a whole to continue supporting and preserving the unique cultural identity of India’s tribal communities. The resurgence and safeguarding of tribal culture enable the restoration of traditional knowledge systems, such as Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa, which challenge the dominance of Western medicine and contribute to the decolonization of India’s healthcare practices. The revival of tribal cultural practices, such as the Dokra metal craft and Warli painting, helps counter the erasure of indigenous art forms caused by colonial influences, fostering cultural diversity and decolonizing artistic expressions. The resurgence of tribal culture also aids in decolonization by reinforcing land rights, as exemplified by the Forest Rights Act of 2006, which recognizes and restores tribal communities’ historic rights over forest lands, challenging colonial-era dispossession. The revival of tribal cultural practices fosters eco-friendly cultural tourism, as seen in the case of the Konkan Railways’ “Tribal Village Tourism” initiative, promoting economic growth, community well-being, and decolonization of tourism narratives. The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

74,13-Oct-23,Lessons from Hamas’ attack on Israel: The fake ‘Genocide of Muslims’ narrative in India will be used to justify Genocide of Hindus as ‘language of oppressed’,"Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door - which they do almost on a regular basisRight before dawn 5 days ago on a Saturday, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. Amidst the scent of death and blood, the wails of tragic loss, the cries for help and the screams of rage, Israel rose as one. Several Israelis travelled back from wherever they were in the world to seek justice – to seek retribution. Old, young, men and women got called into duty – to defend the civilisational home of the Jews and to ensure those who had the blood of children and women on their hands paid a price for their barbarism. Israel then began to pound Gaza with rockers and missiles, flattening whatever stood in its path. On the 13th of October, Israel asked 1.1 million Palestinians to move from the North to the South – the instruction included for UN officials and those hiding in their premises to relocate as well – signalling that Israel was ready for a ground assault. Israel has also shut down the water and electricity supply of Palestine. Israel pleaded with the world – don’t look away. Look at the biggest onslaught against Jews since the Holocaust. Look at what the Islamic terrorists have done. They have killed our babies. Raped our women. Beheaded our sons. They want us gone – annihilated – murdered – humiliated. Don’t. Look. Away – they pleaded. They pleaded because they knew that as a country that fights for its very survival everyday will not be cowered down and that retribution will be theirs. As expected, when Israel started responding to Palestine’s mass violence against Jews, the narrative was not too kind to them, despite the fact that most countries which often gloss over Islamist violence came out vehemently in support of Israel – USA for example. Almost immediately, the narrative shifted to the brewing humanitarian crisis in Palestine with Israel shutting off its water and electricity supply. In one video, the former Prime Minister of Israel screamed – What is wrong with you? We are fighting the Nazis. How can you expect us to give water and electricity to our enemies”. 'Are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? We're fighting Nazis.'Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett adds 'if Hamas use anyone as a human shield, it is their responsibility.'https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/19nBKjOYOQThe media, however, continued what it does best – whitewash the crimes of Muslims and blame the victims of violence of genocide when they choose to stand up and say – ‘Thus far and no further’. The essence of these articles was simple – Israel is committing a genocide of Palestinians by way of its retaliatory action after Jews were raped, murdered, beheaded or injured. They were careful – though. They were careful to also give a “context” to the Palestinian attack against Israel. In an article headlined, “Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked”, The New York Times essentially provided context to the mass murder of rape of Jews by Islamic terrorists. The article said, “In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights”. The subtle agenda-pushing is a work of art that must be fully appreciated. In the article, the New York Times essentially pushes the narrative that Palestinians are lovely people who are very very… very sad about the “loss of lives” in Israel. They are empathetic and don’t support terrorism of any form. However, they are also terribly sad that the USA and perhaps the rest of the world are not understanding the historical context of why these lovely, peaceful, delightful people from Palestine raped, beheaded and tortured Jews in Israel. In turn and as a result, while it was the Jews who got raped, beheaded and tortured, it was the Palestinians who were the real victims not only because Israel launched a counteroffensive against them but also because the barbaric, Islamophobic world was refusing to understand why the Palestinians were forced to murder babies, rape women, behead civilians and torture/murder the men. Further in the New York Times article, another Palestinian is quoted saying the following: “These statements are really dehumanizing us,” she said, “and telling us that our lives are not worth anything.” In the eyes of those officials, she added, “we are never the victim, we are always the aggressor.”This statement was made in response to US’ support to Israel and statements demanding action against Hamas for their misadventure. But do you see what happened here? While the entire article asserted that the Muslims were the victims whether they were killing Israelis, facing retaliatory action or celebrating the murder of Jews, the Palestinian quoted here craftily plays victim to negate the incontrovertible fact that Islamic terrorists are indeed the aggressors. While these op-eds try to paint the Islamic terrorists as “Gandhis with guns”, they gloss over the fact that Gaza has been officially ruled by Hamas since 2017. They gloss over the fact that it is not just Hamas – Palestinians take to the streets to celebrate atrocities against Jews on a regular basis. They gloss over the fact that they may attempt to differentiate between Hamas and civilian Palestinians, but even the civilian Palestinians don’t differentiate between the state of Israel and average, civilian Jews because in the Hamas onslaught, celebrated by Palestinians and Muslims across the globe, those killed were average Jews, average Israelis – women, children, elderly. When we look at the incidents in Israel, this is what the apologists want the world to believe. Interestingly, there is an uncanny parallel to how the world arm twists Hindus every time they come under the attack of Islamists. The parallels of the narrative being crafted post-Hamas violence in Israel and the narrative which is crafted every single time Hindus come under the assault of Islamists have several parallels and lessons that Hindus can draw. While Hamas burnt alive Jewish victims in Israel, Dilbar Negi’s hands and legs were chopped off and he was burnt alive by Islamists in India just 3 years ago. The narrative has been eerily constant regardless of established facts – whether we discuss the partition horrors against Hindus or the current aggressions against Hindus. In this regard, it would bode well to remember the case of Mahashay Rajpal, who published Rangeela Rasool and was ultimately assassinated for it. We mostly hear that Mahashay Rajpal was assassinated for publishing a satirical work on Prophet Muhammad called Rangeela Rasool, but we seldom hear why he chose to publish the book. In 1923, Muslims published two particularly offensive books to Hindus. “Krishna teri geeta jalani padegi” used derogatory and vulgar language against Shri Krishna and other Hindu deities and “Uniseevi sadi ka maharshi” which contained derogatory remarks on Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati (incidentally written by an Ahmadi).In response to this provocation by Islamists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, a close friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a short biography of the Islamic Prophet, Mohammed. “Rangeela Rasool” was a short pamphlet which satirised the life of the Prophet of Islam. Pandit Chamupati made Mahashay Rajpal promise that he would never reveal the name of the author – he knew the consequences of it. Anonymously published under the name “doodh ka doodh aur panee ka panee”, the book enraged Muslims. Staying true to the values of one-way brotherhood, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his pamphlet “Young India”, condemning Rangeela Rasool. While Gandhi ignored the provocation by Muslims, by the end of June 1924, the colonial government banned the book. The Muslim community, partly emboldened by MK Gandhi’s endorsement of their hurt sentiments and whitewashing of the provocation against Hindus, filed multiple cases against the book under 153A. In May 1927, Mahashay Rajpal, who published the book, was acquitted of all charges with the court observing that commentary based on facts on historical figures, including the prophet of Islam, cannot be said to promote enmity between groups. As soon as the verdict was delivered, Muslim mobs went into a frenzy. They rioted and demanded the head of Mahashay Rajpal. They were chants about how the murder of Rajpal was acceptable because, under Sharia, the punishment for blasphemy is death.On April 6th, 1929 a 19-year-old carpenter named Ilm ud din stabbed Mahashay Rajpal on his chest eight times while he was seated in the outer verandah of his shop. Though he was offered to give up the name of the author, Pandit Chamupati Lal, during the court proceedings, he refused and did not yield. He paid the price for it. He paid the price for publishing that book despite the court acquitting him and the Muslims getting a special law to protect their fragile feelings. Before Mahashay Rajpal was murdered brutally, the Muslims got their way and got 295A passed by the British, which aimed to protect their ever-outraged feelings. In this case too, it was the Islamists who mounted the initial onslaught by publishing books insulting Hindus. It was the Hindus who published one book in return. The response to that was the Muslims going on a rampage, rioting, committing violence and beheading Mahashay Rajpal. Through it all, it was the Hindus who were condemned by MK Gandhi while the Muslims, who indulged in violence, became the eternal victims getting a law to protect their feelings. Any conversation around this subject, till date, conveniently glosses over the Muslims publishing the two books first and their rampant violence later – what is remembered is that Hindus published a book that hurt Muslims and that Hindus are the community that must be blamed for the murder of Mahashay Rajpal because the Muslim hurt was justified. Not too long after India was torn apart by those who were convinced that the Muslim community could be placated. Before the Rangeela Rasool controversy, Hindus saw the Khilafat movement, and the support it got from Congress and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and after that, Hindus saw the rise of a Muslim leader like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leading India’s partition.16th August 1946 was the day when the call to massacre Hindus of Bengal was given by Muslim League founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Bengal, the only province in India under Muslim League rule at that time, was apparently chosen by the Muslim League leadership as the suitable place to unleash terror on Hindus in the name of “Direct Action”.In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionising Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against.When Gopal Patha rose to defend the Hindus, it was MK Gandhi who asked him to lay down his weapons. The retaliatory, self-defence action by the Hindus were deemed the original onslaught and the openly religious violence against the Hindus were pushed under the rug to ensure that the Muslims continued to be the universal and eternal victims. Despite the historical atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindus, today, the Media goes no overdrive trying to push the narrative that there is an impending genocide against Muslims that the world is waiting to witness in India. Reams are written on how Hindus harbour animosity against the Muslims, depriving them of their legitimate rights, lynching them, killing them and humiliating them – building up to a genocide – much like that committed supposedly by Israel against Palestine. History and the current onslaught have been systematically whitewashed by historians, scholars, politicians and the corporate media – to an extent that the world has failed to see the realities of the Hindu population. Let us take the Nuh violence recently for example. Thousands of Muslims had descended on Hindus travelling to an area where the dominant demography was of Muslims. they were travelling there to simply worship Lord Shiva on an auspicious day for Hindus. They were pelted with stones, their cars burnt, held hostage inside the temples where the hostages included women and children and attacked with bullets, acid pouches and petrol bombs. Through it all, the narrative was that somehow, it was the Hindus who had provoked the violence because a) they dared to take out a religious procession in an area where Muslims predominantly live after ghettoizing the area and driving Hindus away and b) because of a rumour that a Hindu activist that the Muslims don’t like might be present at the procession – a lie which was spread by the Islamists themselves. Here is how Le Monde wrote about the Nuh violence. First, they turned one-way violence by the Islamists into “violence between Hindus and Muslims” simply because after the one-way violence, the Hindus had decided to defend themselves. Then, they blamed Hindu organisations for “genocide” and “terror” because they dared to speak about the violence and asserted that they would not accept attacks against Hindus. See a pattern with what is happening in Israel? The Islamists unleash violence. Their violence is justified as the language of the oppressed. When Jews decide to defend themselves and retaliate, they are called the aggressors and the terrorists who unleashed violence continue to be the victims, with the real victims being blamed for unleashing hate and genocide simply because they chose to defend themselves. After the brutal beheading of Kanhaiya Lal by two Muslims who then uploaded the beheading video on social media, holding the blood-dripping knife, global media blamed Hindus for asserting that their lives matter too. Here is what the TIME published. At the very onset, author Mansoor shifted the discourse from the beheading of Kanhaiya Lal to supposed ‘chilling calls for revenge’ against the ‘marginalised’ Muslim population. While trying to contextualise the murder of Kanhaiya Lal, Sanya Mansoor suggested that the poor Hindu tailor had drawn the wrath of the Islamists upon himself by supporting the ‘derogatory comments’ of ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, Mansoor also tried to shield the co-religionists of the killers and praise them for their token condemnations. “Muslim politicians and Islamic preachers swiftly condemned the killing,” she asserted while conveniently ignoring their collective silence over calls of ‘Sarr tan se juda chants all over India backed by the same people.Do you see the parallels? Here they are: When a Muslim gets lynched because he was a thief and primarily for such reasons, the media and the global world order are quick to call it an onslaught against Muslims by Hindus, however, when Hindus are lynched, beheaded, raped and murdered for explicitly religious reasons amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, the Hindus have been historically blamed for the violence by the Muslims claiming that the Muslims are indulging in violence because the Hindus have somehow enraged them enough to go on a justified murderous rampage. To prove their point, they even invent crimes where they claim Muslims were beaten up amid Hindu religious slogans simply to justify crimes against Hindus amid chants of Allahu Akbar. They’re lies, screamed from the mountaintops versus our truths meekly repeated, with nobody to listen to us – that is the battle that Hindus have been fighting for millennia. History shows that progressively, a violent minority has strengthened the legislative, judicial and societal cover it gets to assert its religious supremacy aspirations. These aspirations are often negotiated after a violent, vehement and shameless assertion of street veto. The State and leaders who are meant to protect Bharat have bent a knee to the street veto and tried their damndest to assuage the perennially offended, the often violent and the perpetually demanding lot. Their constitutional special status keeps getting reaffirmed either by politicians or the judiciary in the hopes that the ever-so-offended lot will not take to the streets and indulge in rampant violence which the state is woefully incapable of controlling simply to prove just how downtrodden and oppressed they truly are. The intolerant minority has often held a sword to Hindus’ neck and forced us to concede that we have oppressed the sword-wielders.In this bargain, the global world order and the media has followed the pattern of demonising the victims of Islamic violence – the Hindus – and paint the aggressors – the Islamists – and the perpetual victims. In the case of Israel, we see large acceptance of their persecution and acknowledgement of her right to retaliate. Even then, the narrative demonising the Jews for fighting for their survival and civilisational identity is strong enough to spark violence and protests against the victims. Hindus have failed to do what the Jews have done spectacularly well – make the world aware of their own genocide, and their own persecution and ensure that normalisation of that hate is not only a punishable offence but one for which the society itself might ostracise you. We saw that play out after Hamas’ attack against Israel – those students from Harvard who blamed Israel for the terror attack against Jews by Islamic terrorists were forced to retract their statements because corporations started pulling away their job offers. The USA – which when it comes to India whitewashes the Islamic terrorists, was grieved and stood firmly behind Israel’s right to self-defence. The Muslim nations that wanted Israel wiped out mostly stood by mute because they knew the world stood by Israel and her right to self-preservation. As Israel flattens Palestine, there is recognition to some extent that the Jews, especially after suffering from the horrors of the Holocaust, will not stand by and get wiped out again. In India, however, partly because of the failure of Hindus themselves and the systematic whitewashing of history and news by scholars, political leaders and the corporate media, wails of persecution often go unnoticed. In fact, they don’t just go unnoticed, the narrative that we see media, Islamists and Leftists build against Israel today, is a constant against India with other players supporting Israel today joining in as well. Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door – which they do almost on a regular basis – because our own leaders are a part of the narrative demonising Hindus. Take Rahul Gandhi for example and how he today shields Islamists by calling IUML secular, endorsing calls to wipe out Sanatan Dharma, seeking foreign intervention to stop the Hindus and a caste census back home to divide the persecuted. The world will look away as Hindus get slaughtered and the narrative being crafted will blame Hindus for their own persecution and genocide, claiming that the violence unleashed by the Islamists is the “Language of the oppressed” – they are doing that today with Israel – but it would be far easier to do it with Hindus because, unlike Israel, we have traitors amongst ourselves and a world that has normalised persecution of Hindus after we failed to talk about our own plight for centuries. Today, far more than ever, Hindus need to learn from the Jews. Bharat needs to learn from Israel. If we don’t talk about our own persecution – nobody will. If we don’t protect our honour – nobody will. If we don’t stand up to our murderers being painted as the victims – nobody will. And if today we don’t realise the threats of Islamic terror and how it comes even for those who weep for the self-proclaimed marginalised Islamists today. The Hindus’ collective right to retain the cultural, religious and ethical integrity of the only land they have has to be held sacrosanct – legislatively, judicially and socially. This is, perhaps, the one lesson that Israel can teach us – that history is screaming out, waiting for Hindus to hear. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

78,26-Oct-23,"Telangana: BRS MLA K.P. Vivekananda assaults BJP leader Kuna Srisailam Goud and grabs his throat on live TV debate, video goes viral","After that members of both political parties rushed to the stage, smashed barricades, threw chairs and yelled slogans as the scene descended into chaos.Telangana is heading toward assembly election and the political fervor is palpable. Amid this, a live TV debate turned ugly with Bharat Rashtra Samithi Quthbullapur MLA K.P. Vivekananda who is also running from the same constituency physically assaulted Bharatiya Janata Party’s Kuna Srisailam Goud who is a candidate from the same seat. The politicians exchanged charges of seizing land and when Kuna Srisailam Goud criticised the BRS MLA and accused his father of land-grabbing. K.P. Vivekananda lost his tamper in response to these allegations and proceeded to physically assault the BJP leader. He barged towards Goud menacingly and grasped Goud’s neck with his hand. However, the police and others intervened immediately and brought the situation under control. Members of both political parties rushed to the stage, smashed barricades, threw chairs and yelled slogans as the scene descended into chaos.The intensive verbal argument rapidly escalated into a violent action when K.P. Vivekananda aggressively advanced towards Kuna Srisailam Goud. Within seconds, he went from pushing his political opponent to setting aside his microphone and reaching for the BJP leader’s throat and slamming him back with force.The video of this incident went viral on social media.

The polling in the state is scheduled to be held on 30 November.BJP reacted sharply to the unruly behaviour of the BRS leader and proclaimed that the rowdy action was a result of their displeasure at their upcoming defeat at the hands of the former. “What better can be expected from a party of goons,” noted BJP Telangana.

79,26-Oct-23,"‘Activist’ who contested on AAP ticket laments about rise of Hindu temples in US, tries to bring anti-Hindu bill to stop mythical ‘caste discrimination’","Dalit Activist Deelip Mhaske is actively pushing an anti-caste discrimination bill in New Jersey similar to the one that was passed in California but was vetoed by the governor in New Jersey.On 24th October, the New Jersey Monitor published a report authored by journalist Dana Difilippo that revolved around so-called caste discrimination among Hindu Americans. The report focused on the life and activism of Dalit activist Deelip Mhaske, who presents himself as a passionate advocate against caste discrimination. However, his past and statements given for the report, especially about the construction of Hindu temples in the US, should be scrutinised.The report asserted that Indian-Americans, especially Hindu-Americans, have imported caste discrimination to the United States. The statement is overly sweeping and generalising. Despite the fact that caste exists in several religions, including Sikhism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, in countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and others, Hindus were sidelined in the report. Above all, there is a serious lack of data on caste discrimination in the United States.Another problematic statement that Mhaske made while speaking to the New Jersey Monitor was about Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam (BAPS) Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, which is the second largest temple in the world. Mhaske said, “The rise of temples throughout the country is really, really alarming for us because that’s the centre point of starting the caste system, untouchability and discrimination.”Temples do not discriminate against people based on caste. Some temples do not allow people from other faiths to enter the Sanctum Sanctorum; in some cases, only priests who perform Puja at those temples are allowed. Otherwise, there is virtually no discrimination based on caste in any public temple. The problem with so-called activists and “intellectuals” like Mhaske is that they do not understand traditions and equate them with discrimination.He also pointed out the alleged case of discrimination and human trafficking filed against the temple administration. However, the matter is sub judice, and there were reports that the case was filed by luring the workers into believing that if they spoke against the temple, they would get a green card. BAPS has publicly stated that they oppose caste-based discrimination and welcome people from all castes and religions.Mhaske is actively pushing an anti-caste discrimination bill similar to the one that was passed in California but vetoed by the governor in New Jersey. Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer was the only politician supporting him, but she will leave office in January with no chance of contesting again. Interestingly, speaking to NJM, Jaffer said, “Caste hierarchies can be found in Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, and other faiths and in countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Bhutan.”Mhaske also lobbied for the California anti-caste discrimination bill SB403. However, Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed it, stating it was unnecessary and there were already provisions in the existing law to fight any kind of inherited discrimination. Mhaske, after the bill was vetoed, blamed “wealthy businessmen” for lobbying against the bill.He is pushing the anti-caste discrimination bill in New Jersey and lobbying other states to introduce similar bills.In 2018, then-Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations Syed Akabaruddin called out Mhaske and others for spreading disinformation about celebrations of Baba Saheb Ambedkar at the UN. An X (formerly Twitter) user, Lubdhak Vedh, had asked Akbarudding about the reports suggesting India voted against the proposal of celebrating BR Ambedkar’s birthday at the UN. The user pointed out that Mhaske and Dr Munagekar created a “storm” over the issue. Quoting the tweet, Akbaruddin said the birthday would be celebrated at the UN and urged the user not to “go by those who don’t speak for our great country” while calling out Mhaske.Babasaheb Ambedkar is a national icon. His multifaceted contributions have shaped the values that India stands for. As in previous years @IndiaUNNewYork will observe his birth anniversary @UN Don't go by those who don't speak for our great countryJai Hind. 🙏🏽 https://t.co/5bSB1SPbiJInterestingly, another X user, Kailash Vishnu, had replied to Vedh’s tweet and pointed out dubious posts by Mhaske on his now-deleted Facebook account. He pointed out that on 2nd April, he had tried to incite violence in a now-deleted social media post. In that post, he had written, “9 brothers who were martyred in the fight for self-respect. Hundreds of salutes to him. The entire society promises that these warriors. The sacrifice will not go in vain. I will support all the families personally.”Deelip Mhaske posted this then deleted (see image ). This guy is onto something very dangerous for India. He encouraged violence on 2nd April and offered help to those were involved. Hope H.E. @AkbaruddinIndia take a note 🙏. pic.twitter.com/aClnXSf2mOFor those who are unaware, on 2nd April 2018, people from the SC/ST community protested against a Supreme Court order that no arrest could be made without prior permission in the SC/ST Act and allowed a court to grant an anticipatory bail in case the complaint appeared to be an abuse of the law. However, the Government of India amended the law, nullifying the judgment.Kailash also asserted that Mhaske often posted, deleted and recycled his old photos with senior government officials to gain access and traction on social media.Deelip Mhaske works with 'Anti India Forces' to harm India . He is a conman of the highest order. He posts/deletes/recycle old pics on his fb to gain access, e.g. He posted then deleted a few days ago ( w/ @AkbaruddinIndia ) to show both on the same page. Hope GOI is alert. pic.twitter.com/XaB1ufjsNnInterestingly, Mhaske uses photos with leaders and even with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his website, which gives the idea that he works for the government.Interestingly, Mhaske contested the Lok Sabha elections on AAP’s ticket in 2014 from the Jalna constituency in Maharashtra. Of 10,66,259 votes, Mhaske had secured 4,622 votes or 0.43 per cent of the vote share. In other words, Mhaske lost his deposit in the election.Mhaske, who has been pushing anti-caste discrimination bills across states in the US, has a dubious past and is often seen passing anti-Hindu comments. In July 2023, he wrote for The Print, in which he tried to assert that while thousands of SC/ST/OBC students were quitting IITs and central universities, PM Modi was busy inaugurating and building temples. Interestingly, he mentioned the Ram Mandir, which is being constructed in Ayodhya. Mhaske forgot that the temple is not being built by the government but with money donated by the devotees. He cited the data shared in Rajya Sabha, where it was mentioned that 17,545 marginalised students dropped from central universities and 8,139 marginalised students dropped out from IITs.However, he conveniently ignored the fact that in the case of postgraduate and PhD programmes, the main reason for dropping was cited as “offers for placement in public sector enterprises and personal preference for better opportunities elsewhere”. For undergraduate programs, the reason was noted as “wrong choices filled, poor performance, and personal and medical reasons”. Going by the cited reasons, accusing PM Modi of the same was going over the board. Furthermore, it was also mentioned that the government took corrective measures in the universities and IITs to reduce dropouts. Still, it was nowhere mentioned in the article written by Mhaske.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Maulvi K M Iliyas Riyazi made the statement during a protest organised by Jamaats and Muslim outfits in Coimbatore against Israel on Tuesday.A video of the speech has appeared on social media, in which the Maulvi can be heard making anti-India and anti-Israel comments without naming India. He said that there are “two terrorist states in the world, one is Israel and the other is the one we live now.”However, he added a disclaimer that he would not call our country India because India had always stood for peace. He tried to claim that India has become a terrorist state because PM Narendra Modi visited Israel.“In the last 70 years, India has seen several prime ministers from Nehru to Manmohan Singh, but none of them made an official visit to Israel. Only Modi has made an official visit to Israel,” he said.He further said, “During his visit, Israel PM Netanyahu said, ‘We had to wait 70 years for an Indian PM to visit Israel’,” adding that Modi fulfilled the 70-year wish of Israel.#PresidentRemoveKesriThis Speech Should be Crime of War.Indian Muslim Says There are only 2 terrorist states in this whole world.

The participants chanted various slogans like , “Let the Zionist group fall”, “Inquilab Inquilab, Palestinian Inquilab”, “Lal Salaam, Assalaam, Intifada Inquilab” etc.They condemned Israel accusing it of being involved in a genocide by violating international laws and human rights. The protesters also attacked the US for extending support to Israel.The speakers of the protest demanded that the Indian govt should not support Israel, and should stand behind Palestine. They also claimed that except for the BJP and RSS, all political parties were united in their support for the people of Palestine.Moulbi Farooq Imamam from Jamia Masjid said, “We have taken out a procession against Israel and America. Israel is the illegitimate child of America which has occupied Palestine. It has set records in brutality and terror.

Balasaheb had raised the slogan 'Proudly say we are Hindus' from Shiv Teerth, but slogans like 'Proudly say we are Congressmen and socialists' are being given from that place.""On Tuesday (24th October), Maharashtra’s chief minister Eknath Shinde addressed Shiv Sena’s traditional annual Dussehra meeting at the Azad Maidan in South Mumbai. In his speech, he criticised Uddhav Thackeray. Addressing a huge rally at Shiv Sena’s Dussehra rally at Azad Maidan, without naming Thackeray, Shinde said he had stabbed Bal Thackeray in the back by dishonesty with his ideological heritage. Eknath Shinde said that Uddhav Thackeray left the Hindutva ideology long ago and can now even embrace Islamic terrorist outfits like Hamas.Wishing one and all on the occasion of Dussehra, Eknath Shinde said, “This is an Azad meeting of an Azad Shiv Sena on the Azad Maidan. It is this Azad Maidan where people would stage protests in the pre-independence era against British rule. Balasaheb Thackeray used to address the Dussehra meeting on Shiv Teerth (Shivaji Park ground). People are holding their rallies at that place today. We are at Azad Maidan.

He said, “The parties that used to target the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by questioning the timeline for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya are now feeling embarrassed. They are now exposed. How will they go to Ayodhya now?”Shinde claimed that Uddhav Thackeray had ambitions of becoming chief minister since 2004, but it could not happen. He said, “He wished to become the chief minister since 2004 but the ‘jugaad’ did not work. He showed that he had never been interested in this post. It was publicly stated that he accepted the responsibility for Sharad Pawar’s advice after the 2019 assembly elections. But the fact is that two persons were sent to Pawar to recommend his name for this post. He is wearing many masks. He takes advantage of the opportunity.”Eknath Shinde said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi will come to power for the third consecutive time next year. We will send 45 MPs from Maharashtra to strengthen him. It was Modi who fulfilled Bal Thackeray’s dreams through the removal of Article 370 and the construction of Ram Mandir.

82,23-Oct-23,"A Pakistani Hindu is not safe in Pakistan, but now is not safe from the Islamist- liberal lynch mob in India too: How Danish Kaneria is being abused for taking on Arfa Khanum Sherwani","Despite her privileged life in India, Arfa Khanum Sherwani's social media identity is based on a false and inflated sense of victimhood. Former Pakistani cricketer, Danish Kaneria, is now being vilified and abused on social media by Islamists residing in Pakistan and by the scores of radicals in India.His only mistake was that he had asked the senior editor of The Wire, Arfa Khanum Sherwani, to not insult the Indian cricket fans. The ‘journalist announced that she was ashamed of her Indian identity on account of the ‘majoritarianism’ displayed by Indian fans during the 2023 World Cup.Danish Kaneria, who happens to be the second Hindu to play for Pakistan, thus asked the ‘privileged’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan if she has issues with her Indian identity.Come to my country Pakistan if you are feeling ashamed to be an Indian. India doesn’t need people like you. I am sure many people in India will be happy to sponsor this trip. https://t.co/kYV91bDEiEIt was The Wire ‘journalist’ who made it about her Indian identity and how she was ashamed of it. When Danish Kaneria merely gave her a suggestion that would let her live her life without ‘shame’ by going to Pakistan, Arfa Khanum Sherwani resorted to playing the ‘Muslim victim card.’ She first accused him of unleashing an online ‘lynch mob’ against her and that claimed that Danish Kaneria’s comment was rooted in communalism. The propaganda artist alleged that asking an Indian Muslim to ‘go to Pakistan’ is a display of majoritarianism.Interestingly, Kaneria is a Hindu minority living in Muslim-dominated Pakistan. As such, her suggestion that his tweet reeked of majoritarian in some way was bizarre and devoid of any rationale.Yes,every word of your tweet was communal. Asking an Indian Muslim to ‘go to Pakistan’ is as communal& majoritarian as asking a Pakistani Hindu to convert to Islam.It is telling the minority people that you don’t belong here or not until you convert to majority religionGot it? https://t.co/n8J5u5OsxLArfa Khanum Sherwani, who has never talked about the deplorable plight of Hindus or other religious minorities in Pakistan, drew false equivalence by converting a mere slogan of ‘go to Pakistan’ to actual incidents of forced conversion in the Islamic country.“Asking an Indian Muslim to ‘go to Pakistan’ is as communal& majoritarian as asking a Pakistani Hindu to convert to Islam. It is telling the minority people that you don’t belong here or not until you convert to majority religion. Got it?” she brazened out.The Wire ‘journalist’ has conveniently ignored the menace of forced conversion of Hindus to Islam to not alienate her supporters from across the border. However, she was quick to rake up the issue only to perpetuate her false sense of victimhood.In an EXPLOSIVE interview with Zee News, Ex-Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria claims Shahid Afridi forced him to convert to Islam, reveals which Indian batter was a nightmare for Pakistan team, & opens up about #ViratKohliVsBabarAzam debate@DanishKaneria61 @kanaujia_rachit pic.twitter.com/R0M02gTmWzAs a matter of fact, Danish Kaneria has been abused on social media for daring to speak up on forced conversion. When he was part of the Pakistan cricket dressing room, he was humiliated and subjected to discrimination for being a Hindu.This was confirmed by former Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar. Danish Kaneria has gone on record to highlight how Pakistani all-rounder Shahid Afridi tried to convert him to Islam. One could only imagine if a cricketer was subjected to such an ordeal, then, what would be the plight of common Hindus in Islamic Pakistan? Far from empathising with Danish Kaneria, Arfa Khanum Sherwani used the ex-cricketer’s disturbing experience to lecture him about forced conversion.I am not taking about conversion, majoritarianism, Hindus, Indian Muslims or religion. I am simply talking about your ‘loyalty’. Got it? Let’s end the debate with single answer — “Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” https://t.co/xtuZ06RL0KThe former Pakistani cricketer did not stoop down to her level and instead challenged the propaganda artist to show a tweet where she displayed her pride for Bharat and its culture. He emphasised, “I am simply talking about your ‘loyalty’. Got it? Let’s end the debate with single answer — “Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” Arfa Khanum Sherwani has yet to respond to him. Interestingly, she had replied promptly when it came to her ‘religious victim card.’ Nonetheless, the leftist-Islamist nexus came to her rescue and character assassinated Danish Kaneria for taking Arfa Khanum Sherwani head-on.Seema Chisti, an editor at The Wire, claimed, “Like all sensible Indians, Arfa is appalled, and rightly so, by the display of jingoism and petty-mindedness. She does not need to go anywhere else – far from it – many more people here and everywhere else need to call it out – each time when it is not cricket.””Like all sensible Indians, @khanumarfa is appalled, and rightly so, by the display of jingoism and petty-mindedness. She does not need to go anywhere else ☺️ – far from it – many more people here and everywhere else need to call it out – each time when it is not cricket. https://t.co/MgQDG4M7Dz‘Journalist’ Mrinal Pande brazened out, “Arfa Khanum Sherwani is one of our best, winner of the prestigious Chameli Devi Jain award for excellence in reporting. She is rightly incensed by this xenophobic madness. We in the media firmly stand by her.”@khanumarfa is one of our best, winner of the prestigious Chameli Devi Jain award for excellence in reporting. She is rightly incensed by this xenophobic madness. We in the media firmly stand by her. https://t.co/6I97OlSCz6Part-time ‘journalist’ claimed that Indians are supporting Danish Kaneria only because Arfa Khanum Sherwani happens to be a ‘Muslim.’ In that way, he lent credence to her perpetual state of victimhood.Indian right wing in a nutshell:Supporting an ex cricketer who's trolling a journalist only because she's a Muslim.It doesn't matter that the ex-cricketer was banned for life for spot fixing.One more member of the leftist-Islamist nexus alleged that the support for Kaneria from the Indians stemmed from his Hindu identity.A Pakistani Match Fixer who was banned for life is trolling an Indian Journalist and Indian RW is supporting the Pakistani Spot-fixer. Because the Pakistani the Matchfixer is Hindu and the Indian Journalist is Muslim and for Indian RW, Religion comes before NationCongress leader Gaurav Gogoi also threw his weight behind The Wire ‘journalist’ and claimed that her tweets was a reflection of India’s unity in diversity.“This debate for me highlights India’s greatest strength and strategic asset. Our ability to appreciate and defend our pluralism. This is why 1.2 billion people have remained proud and united. Indians will always rise to protect our DNA “unity in diversity’. #MohabbatKiDukan,” he said.This debate for me highlights India’s greatest strength and strategic asset. Our ability to appreciate and defend our pluralism. This is why 1.2 billion people have remained proud and united. Indians will always rise to protect our DNA “unity in diversity’. #MohabbatKiDukan https://t.co/nqesa5h0dVAlt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair, who has a history of peddling fake news, tried to guilt-trip Danish Kaneria for calling out Arfa Khanum Sherwani’s attempt to shame Indian cricket fans. He shared a 5-year-old video of Kaneria confessing to the 2009 Essex spot-fixing scandal in the hopes of character-assassinating Kaneria. Zubair has been involved in viciously defending rabid Islamists and unleashing his online lynch mob against Hindus. A classic case of his dog whistling and brazen propaganda was the Nupur Sharma controversy of May 2022. The ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma found herself at the centre of a raging storm after Islamists, egged on by the likes of AltNews co-founder Mohammed Zubair, issued multiple threats against her and her family for expressing her views on Prophet Muhammad and Islam. Now that Danish Kaneria is trending. Here is his old (2018) confession video of his Match Fixing involvement in England. pic.twitter.com/ckbNDQIHI6Sharma was part of a debate panel on Times Now, discussing the finding of Shivling in the Gyanvapi complex and the subsequent mockery of the Hindu Gods and Goddesses that followed in the wake of the discovery. Islamists had claimed that the Shivling discovered inside the wuzukhana of the Gyanvapi disputed structure was not a Shivling but a fountain. Across social media platforms, detractors had repeated ad nauseam that the Shivling found inside the Gyanvapi premises was a fountain and not an idol of a Hindu God. In response to the contempt and scorn poured over Hindu Gods and Goddesses, BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma asked them to refrain from insulting Hindu Gods and cited Islamic scriptures and Holy Quran for substantiating her remarks on Prophet Muhammad and Islam.Zubair shared an incomplete video of the debate, touching off Sar Tan Se Juda protests all over the country. While Islamists went on a rampage on the streets in many cities across the country, it was essentially Mohammed Zubair who was responsible for kindling a fire that had gone on to assume uncontrollable proportions.It was Zubair’s dog-whistling that made a mountain out of a molehill and painted a target behind the back of Nupur Sharma and anyone and everyone who came out in her support. The ominous hounding of Nupur Sharma prompted many to extend their support to her. At the heart of this online spat between a former Pakistani cricketer and an Indian ‘journalist’ was the latter’s tirade against her Indian identity. While she could have limited her rant to Indian cricket fans, she extended it to her identity as an Indian. “Deplorable behaviour of many cricket fans during World Cup matches, makes me feel embarrassed &ashamed as an Indian,” Arfa Khanum Sherwani tweeted on Sunday (22nd October).Deplorable behaviour of many cricket fans during World Cup matches, makes me feel embarrassed &ashamed as an Indian.This petty, insecure & majoritarian approach towards sports which was meant to bring people together, is symbolic of India Modi-RSS have created in last one decadeAnd it wasn’t the first time when Arfa Khanum Sherwani expressed shame about being an Indian to further her political agenda. In October 2021, she claimed, “Every time I think of Siddique Kappan, I feel ashamed as an Indian and as a journalist. Today marks one year since he has been incarcerated on charges of sedition. He was booked under UAPA – a terror law. He is paying the price of being honest, being a journalist and a Muslim.”Every time I think of #SiddiqueKappan, I feel ashamed as an Indian and as a journalist.Today marks one year since he has been incarcerated on charges of sedition. He was booked under UAPA-a terror law.He is paying the price of being honest, being a journalist and a Muslim.In December 2018, the propaganda artist dubbed the patriotic slogan of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ as ‘communal’ and majoritarian slogan. This has prompted Danish Kaneria to question her loyalty to India and its culture. Despite being discriminated against by his countrymen for the virtue of being a Hindu and pressured into converting to Islam, Danish Kaneria’s loyalty lies with Pakistan. Far from being ashamed of his national identity, he is rather proud of it.“Valid point. I was born in Pakistan, played for Pakistan and proud to be a Pakistani. Some cheap people discriminated against me, but I can’t blame all for this. I can’t abuse my country. Yes, if anything goes wrong with my community I will keep raising voice for them,” he added.Valid point.I was born in Pakistan, played for Pakistan and proud to be a Pakistani. Some cheap people discriminated against me, but I can’t blame all for this. I can’t abuse my country. Yes, If anything goes wrong with my community I will keep raising voice for them. https://t.co/HSMF5BjfrEThe same cannot be said about Arfa Khanum Sherwani. She is yet to respond to the challenge by Danish Kaneria. Instead, the tweets by Arfa Khnaum Sherwani, attacking her national identity and chants of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’, are there for everyone to see.As such, the suggestion by the former Pakistani cricketer to The Wire ‘journalist; to migrate to Pakistan is in fact a testament to her dwindling and questionable ‘loyalty’ to India.As evident from the entire discourse on social media, a Hindu can never truly be a victim in the eyes of an Islamist. A Hindu minority in Pakistan such as Danish Kaneria, who is subjected to discrimination on an everyday basis, is being given lessons in ‘majoritarianism’ and ‘communalism’ by a privileged, well-to-do Arfa Khanum Sherwani.Her ridiculous defence on social media came at the expense of downplaying the real-life atrocities committed by the Hindus in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Despite this, the leftist-Islamist nexus did not waste any time and came to her rescue.I am 200 percent sure, you won't leave India, where would an Ashraf Muslim woman would get such privilege to play victim while abusing the nation. https://t.co/aH0Y1wjUJHDespite her privileged life in India, Arfa Khanum Sherwani’s social media identity is based on a false and inflated sense of victimhood. She has indeed been successful in using her Indian identity as bait for political posturing with little to no consequences.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

83,23-Oct-23,Pinarayi Vijayan-led Communist government to create a microsite on ‘Islam in Kerala’ to attract tourists,"As per the details of the project, the first chapter will cover the ‘History of Islam in Kerala’. It will have details regarding how Islam entrenched its roots in Kerala through traders and their first settlement along the Malabar coast. The Pinarayi Vijayan-led Communist government in Kerala will soon create a microsite on ‘Islam in Kerala’ to promote tourism in the state, as reported by The Hindu on 21st October (Saturday). The microsite will be a promotional digital production that will trace the roots of Islam in Kerala.The Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government is starting a project (microsite) to throw light on the rich culture of Islam in the state.The microsite aims to cast a spotlight on the early years of Islam in Kerala, covering topics such as mosques, architectural marvels, lifestyle,… pic.twitter.com/CvUkmtqGDQTo showcase the socio-cultural evolution of Islam in Kerala, the Minister for Public Works & Tourism Kerala, P. A. Mohammed Riyas has sanctioned Rs 93.8 lakh for this digital production.A senior officer with Kerala Tourism stated that Islam boasts a rich history, culture, and tradition in Kerala which dates back to the 7th century. The digital production will shed light on the early years of Islam in Kerala. It will cover subjects like mosques, architecture, lifestyle, culture, art forms, and festivals.According to the officer, as part of state tourism promotion, they will gather all information about the Islamic influence that shaped Kerala in one place. This will attract religious scholars and historians to the state. The officer further said, “There is a need to bring together all the information on Islam, which played an important role in shaping Kerala, under one roof, as part of tourism promotion. This will help tourists and play a major role in bringing religious scholars, historians, students, and pilgrims to Kerala.” The microsite ‘Islam in Kerala’ will shed light on Islam in the state through six chapters. The aim of the microsite is to showcase it to international and domestic tourists.  As per the details of the project, the first chapter will cover the ‘History of Islam in Kerala’. It will have details regarding how Islam entrenched its roots in Kerala through traders and their first settlement along the Malabar coast. In Chapter Two, the microsite will cover the Islamic pilgrimage centres in the state, spanning from Beemapally in Thiruvananthapuram to Juma Masjid in Kasaragod.It will feature a range of ancient mosques that are pilgrim centres in the state. These include the Cheraman Juma Masjid in Kodungallur, Jama-at Mosque in Malappuram, Mishkal Mosque in Kozhikode, Odathil Palli in Thalassery, Palayam Mosque in Thiruvananthapuram, Ponnani Juma Masjid, Pazhayangadi Mosque in Kondotty and Vavar Mosque in Erumely.The microsite’s Chapter Three will cover the culinary skills of Muslims. This will include the Mappila cuisine, a blend of traditional Kerala, Persian, Yemeni, and Arabian food cultures. The fourth chapter will focus on the community’s lifestyle, highlighting the costumes worn during weddings, pre-wedding, and post-wedding ceremonies, which could attract tourists.In Chapter Five focused on architecture, the communist government wants to showcase the ‘blend’ of the Arabian tradition with the indigenous construction techniques in Kerala.The sixth and final chapter will deal with art forms and festivals of Muslims in Kerala. This will reportedly include the influence of Mappila songs which are popular folklore that emerged in the 16th century. As per the Hindu report, Kerala Tourism earlier created similar microsites on Christianity, Judaism, and temples in Kerala.However, the Kerala Tourist Minister Mohammed Riyas is being accused of trying to establish several myths as history in the garb of this microsite on Islam.Muhammad Riyas-led-Kerala Tourism to create a microsite on the roots of Islam in Kerala & allocated Rs. 93.8 lakhs for the same! They claim the Islamic history of Kerala dates back to 7th century, a myth fabricated around a Masjid which was actually built in 14th century.…Following the reports on the microsite, Islam in Kerala, Author J Nandakumar who is currently the National Convenor of Prajna Pravah, launched a scathing attack on the Tourist minister accusing him of fabricating history.  Taking to X, Nandakumar wrote, “They claim the Islamic history of Kerala dates back to the 7th century, a myth fabricated around a Masjid which was actually built in the 14th century.” He added, “The proposed govt project (microsite on Islam) seems to be aimed at establishing 3 myths as history: First – Conversion of Cheraman Perumal. Second – Cheraman (Juma) Masjid as the 7th-century structure. Third – Islam in Kerala is as old as Arabian Islam.” The proposed govt project seems to be aimed at establishing 3 myths as history: 1. Conversion of Cheraman Perumal. 2. Cheraman Masjid as 7th century structure.3. Islam in Kerala is as old as Arabian Islam.Notably, Prajna Pravah is an intellectual movement rooted in Bharatiya ethos and traditions and is a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliated organisation. According to several myths, it is claimed that the Cheraman Masjid was built in the 7th Century. However, many scholars have disputed this and have dated the structure to the 14th-15th century based on the architectural style.As per the Cheramanmosque website, Cheraman Perumal, the reigning King of Kerala,  (Kodungallur as its capital) converted to Islam in the later phase of his life. Before dying, he wrote letters to local rulers of Malabar and gave them to his friends. Later, when Malik Bin Dinar and his companions reached Kodungallur, they handed over the letters to the ruling chieftains. Subsequently, they were given permission to construct mosques in different places. The first mosque in India was thus constructed at Kodungallur and Malik Bin Dinar himself was the first Ghazi of this “Cheraman Masjid”.According to the mosque’s website, the early history of Kerala is a bundle of myths and legends. The intense dynastic struggle that existed then, culminated in the election of a ruler called Perumals. The political scene in Kerala is clearer only after the abdication of the last of the Perumals, Cheraman Perumal.On the behest of letters of Cheraman Perumal (reigning King of Kerala who converted to Islam), this mosque at Kodungallur is the first to be established. The website adds that Kerala Vyasan Kunhikuttan Thampuran (1864-1913) is of the opinion that a defunct Buddha vihar was handed over to the nascent Muslims to establish a mosque there. It is believed that the mosque was first renovated or reconstructed sometime in the 11th Century AD and later again 300 years ago, the website added. The last renovation was done in 1974. For all these regions, several scholars have asserted that it is a myth that Cheraman Masjid could be a 7th-century structure which is being alleged that the Kerala Tourist Minister is doing in the garb of microsite, ‘Islam in Kerala’. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

84,22-Oct-23,"Rahul Gandhi spreads propaganda against Agnipath Scheme again by claiming kin of deceased Agniveer soldier will not get anything, here are the facts","As per the Agnipath Scheme, the next of kin of Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, who died in Siachen, will receive receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amountDays after the Aam Aadmi Party tried to play politics over the death of an Agniveer soldier, now Rahul Gandhi has joined the dirty politics after the death of another Agniveer jawan recruited under the new Agnipath Scheme.On Sunday (22 October), the Indian Army’s Fire and Fury Corps informed that Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman lost his life while posted at Siachen glacier. The corps posted on X, “All ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest condolences to the family.”Quartered in snow silent to remain, when the bugle calls they shall rise and march againAll ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest… pic.twitter.com/1Qo1izqr1UThe reason for the death has not been disclosed, but most tragedies in the glacier take place due to natural disasters like avalanches.Hours after the news of the unfortunate death of the soldier was published, Rahul Gandhi alleged that his family will not get any monetary payment, like the families of regular soldiers receive. In a tweet posted in Hindi, Rahul Gandhi wrote, “A young man was martyred for the country – no gratuity, no other military facilities during his service, and no pension to his family in martyrdom.”He further added that ‘Agniveer is a plan to insult the heroes of India’.However, the allegations of Rahul Gandhi are completely false and inaccurate, and families of Agniveer soldiers who loss their lives in the line of duty do receive emoluments. As per terms of the Agnipath scheme, the Next of Kin of an Agniveer soldier who becomes a battle casualty receives ₹48 Lakh as Non-Contributory Insurance and Ex-gratia of ₹44 Lakh.Apart from this, they also receive the amount of Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer, with an equal matching contribution by the Govt, along with the interest. The Next of Kin will also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death, till the completion of four years, which is the term of employment under the scheme. In Gawate Akshay Laxman’s case, his family will receive over ₹13 lakh in total.Not only this, the next of kin will also be paid a contribution of ₹8 Lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund. Therefore, the next of kin of the deceased Agniveer soldier will receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amount, which could be around ₹3 lakh for service of one year, as opposed to Rahul Gandhi’s claim that they will receive no monetary compensation.It is notable that the Seva Nidhi contribution is 30% of the salary.Rahul Gandhi has been spreading false propaganda against the Agnipath scheme, designed to turn Indian defence forces into a younger force. He had claimed that the scheme was a brainchild of RSS, alleging that the scheme will create unemployed youths trained in guns, and will create violence in society. It is notable that Rahul Gandhi’s comments were the same as comments of PFI about the scheme, who had claimed that retired Agniveer soldiers would form groups to attack Muslims.Earlier AAP had attacked the scheme after Agniveer Amritpal Singh died in Kashmir, after he was not provided a military guard of honour during his funeral. The Indian Army had then explained that no guard of honour or military funeral was provided because Singh had died from suicide. The Army said that this is the existing policy for all soldiers, not just for Agnivereers.“Unfortunate instances of death arising out of suicide/self-inflicted injury, irrespective of the type of entry, are accorded due respect by the Armed Forces along with deep and enduring empathy with the family. Such cases, however, are not entitled to Military Funerals as per the extant Army Order of 1967, in vogue,” the Indian Army had said.Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveer soldiers are recruited for 4 years, with 25% of them eligible to enter regular service. Soldiers who retire after four years will be opportunity to work at PSUs, government agencies, paramilitary forces, and state governments. They also receive the Sewa Nidhi corpus of ₹10.04 lakh along with interest.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

85,21-Oct-23,"Welfare Party of India may be an example of communist stupidity in supporting terror, but they didn’t use the Italy flag to support Palestine: Fact Check","The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, in the party's flag, there is a yellow olive leaves symbol and the words 'Welfare Party' in the middle panelAs Israel continues its military action against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas, Islamists and leftists worldwide, who are traditionally anti-Israel, are protesting against Israel and in support of Hamas and Palestine. A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine. In the photos, the protestors were seen carrying a large number of flags which looked like the Italian flag.HILARIOUS: The Welfare Party in Kerala, India took out a rally in favor of Palestinians, but they brought ITALIAN flags instead of the Palestinian flag. 😂 #FreeItaly https://t.co/GKRCuyYuYUAs both the flags of Italy and Palestine contain the same colours, red, green and white, people assumed that the party mistakenly picked the wrong flag for the protest. The protestors were seen carrying a large banner saying ‘Free Palestine’, apart from the flag with green, white and red vertical bands.“Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal,” tweeted activist and radio talk show host Charlie Kirk.Thousands of members of the Welfare Party in Kerala, India march with Italian flags mistaking then for the Palestinian flag, while holding letters that read: “Free Palestien”Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal. pic.twitter.com/YLYAB4A53SMany other X users posted similar tweets, mocking the political party for carrying the Italian flag instead of the Palestinian flag.Welfare Party of India in Kerala took out this rally in support of Palestine but with flag of Italy.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest.

86,13-Oct-23,Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral,"The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

87,07-Oct-23,Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

88,25-Oct-23,"Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar, ‘Adolf Hitler’ and 1900+ others sign an open letter contextualising Hamas attack against Israel, where they raped and beheaded Jews","The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on IsraelAs Israeli military action against Hamas in Gaza continues in retaliation to the horrific terror attack by Hamas on 7 October, some 1,900 plus odd sociology “professors” have signed an open letter in solidarity with Gaza and Palestinians. The letter, a typical rant of the left, calls to “contextualise” the Hamas terror attack that killed over 1400 innocent Israelis and displaced over 2 lakh civilians in Israel.The letter is published as a Google Doc, which can be edited by people after requesting edit permission. NEW: 1,700 sociology professors sign a letter accusing Israel of ""genocide"" and arguing that Hamas terror must be ""contextualize[d]"" as a response to ""75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.""Our professors are seething with hatred against the West. pic.twitter.com/4lxaftaepzThe excerpt reads, “As educators, it is our duty to stand by the principles of critical inquiry and learning, to hold the university as a space for conversation that foregrounds historical truths, and that contextualises this past week’s violence in the context of 75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.”The letter has been signed by professors from Ivy League institutes including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Brown, Berkeley, and others. And when the elite progressives have it in them to speak up for the downtrodden, how can the Indian left not rise to the occasion?We've scanned the list and found Nandini Sundar, wife of American far-left propagandist, Siddarth Varadarajn is one of the signatories supporting Hamas. Also includes students from IITB, TISS, OP Jindal, Ashoka Uni, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, AMU, DU. https://t.co/0k1q2okbup pic.twitter.com/Mtz71dUe19Among those Indians who have signed the letter are The Wire founder Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar. The Indian signatories to the letter also include students from IIT Bombay, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), OP Jindal, Ashoka University, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), and Delhi University (DU).However, the biggest irony in this document is that a person named Adolf Hitler, who is listed as “professor emeritus, Sociology, University of Austria”, is also a signatory. However, it seems that later the name Adolf Hitler was removed from the list. It is notable that anyone can add any name to sign the list, and it is possible that some of the names are fake. Moreover, as it is an editable document, someone is going through the signatures and removing suspicious sounding names, like Adolf Hitler. Spotted this signature. https://t.co/1u2II2bW87 pic.twitter.com/QZBU5h470dMoreover, the letter does not condemn Hamas and the carnage it unleashed on Israeli civilians on 7th October killing more than 1,400 innocent people and taking more than 200 captive. It also does not mention that Hamas is also responsible for the death of civilian Palestinians in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, as Hamas has been preventing civilians from evacuating north Gaza despite repeated warnings by Israel. In fact, the letter just once makes the mention of Hamas violence but does so in a matter-of-factly tone as against the 300+ words of Israel bashing.The letter reads, “While claiming its actions are a justifiable response to recent Hamas violence against Israeli civilians, it has targeted the civilian Palestinian population of Gaza, while exhibiting little regard for the loss of human life.” The letter also objects to the use of ‘racist and dehumanizing language’ for Hamas terrorists, referring to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant using the term ‘human animals’ for Hamas terrorists/Clearly, the signatories made the conscious choice of not acknowledging the unspeakable atrocities inflicted upon Israeli civilians including women and babies. One of the appalling excerpts of the letter reads, “This latest siege comes as a continuation and escalation of the daily violence Palestinians faced for decades from Israeli colonisation…”The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on Israel. That it consciously leaves out any mention of the terrorist attack and talks about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the context of “75 years of settler colonial occupation” shows how this global left lobby joiin forces with Islamists to legitimise the existence of terrorist groups like Hamas.Netizens have pointed out several flaws in the letter that raise questions on the credibility of the letter and even its signatories. There is of course the Adolf Hitler bit for one. “Academic Watchdog” Steve McGuire shared an image of the document while it was still accepting entries showing how the document has several collaborators.Captured some editing. pic.twitter.com/qT7wYQ8VEcX user Abigail Anthony, a writer, also recorded a 33-second video while the document was still being edited. The name of Michael Rodriguez, an associate professor of Sociology at the University of California, appeared on the document as he deleted an entry signed by the name Jill Biden, “professor, Northern Virginia Community College”.The apparent editor of the document goes by the name Michael Rodriguez-Muniz on X, formerly Twitter, and had first shared the open letter on 18th October calling on his followers to sign and share the same.Open Letter: Sociologists in Solidarity with GazaSign on and Share!https://t.co/xPLyic4welAuthor and Professor Bradley Campbell pointed out on X that the list consists of “mostly usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students.

The left has become irrelevant, and Islam is their only fodder for the want of a revolution. Unfortunately, the victims of terrorism continue to have to fight for justice even in death.

89,25-Oct-23,Islamists claim freed Israeli hostage was treated well by Hamas but here is what she said narrating her harrowing tale at the hands of the Islamic terrorists,"The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. On Tuesday (24th October), the Hamas terrorists released two Israeli hostages among the 220 held. The two released women have been identified as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yochaved Lifshitz, 85. It is being said that these two were released due to their deteriorating health conditions. While some of the Islamist and left-leaning media portals lauded the terrorists for providing the women with medicines and tea during their captivity, one of the women talked to the media after being released by Hamas terrorists to reveal that she went through hell and was beaten by the terrorists. Several Islamists and media channels released videos of the women being released by the Hamas terrorists and claimed that they were being offered tea and cookies. The Islamists also referred to the Hamas terrorists who launched a brutal attack on Israel on 7th October as ‘fighters’. One of the social media users shared a video clip by BBC News media which showed the daughter of one of the women praising the terrorists. The daughter could be heard saying that the terrorists treated her mother well and gave her medicines. “Another major blow to Israel’s propaganda machine,” the Islamist user tweeted.

However, one of the released women talked to the media and said that she was assaulted and that she had to see hell on this Earth due to Hamas terrorists.🚨Hamas published a video showing the moment of the release of two female hostages – Nurit Cooper and Yochaved Lifshitz.

One can safely assume that any victim of such brutality when released from captivity, would be in shock. The victim would also feel gratitude for being released from captivity and in that moment, while still in fear by the torture inflicted, may make statements downplaying the brutality that she faced. However, for the Islamists to use that moment of fear to whitewash the crimes mounted by Jihadis only goes to show how desperate the ecosystem is to paint Hamas as good samaritans instead of the terrorists they are, given that they beheaded, raped, tortured and murdered over 1500 Jews. The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. While the Islamists tried to paint Hamas as good samaritans, the released woman identified as Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, said, “They beat me, laid me on a motorcycle, and rode through the fields with me towards Gaza. They brought me to the tunnels; we walked kilometres underground. They beat me in the ribs, even with sticks.” Further exposing the brutality of the Hamas terrorists, the woman said that she was abducted on a motorbike by the terrorists and her head was on one side and her body on the other when on the bike. “When I was on the bike, my head was on one side and the rest of my body on the other side. The young men hit me on the way. They didn’t break my ribs but it was painful and I had difficulty breathing,” she was quoted as saying. “I’ve been through hell … we didn’t think or know we would get to this situation,” she added. The large influential accounts who shared Hamas giving tea to the 85 years old hostages yesterday were only helping the murderous Hamas terrorists spread their propaganda. Yochaved Lifshitz, who escaped captivity by the murderers and Nazis Hamas-ISIS: ""They beat me, laid me on… pic.twitter.com/K3tiFlSwXwThe woman also stated that they were provided with only one time of meal and that barely included a cucumber and some cheese. ‘I was assaulted and beaten with sticks,” she reiterated. However, the released hostage revealed that the terrorists seemed prepared for this situation as they had everything in there that men and women needed including shampoo. “They treated us well and provided all our needs. They also ate the same food as they provided it to us,” the woman added. After being released, the woman could be seen shaking hands with the terrorists. On asking about it, she said that she did so because she was treated ‘well’ during the captivity and was provided with medicines. Notably, Lifshitz’s husband is still held hostage by the Hamas terrorists. It is important to note that the Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the Jewish state on 7th October killing around 1400 Israelis and injuring several others. The terrorists raped the Israeli women, murdered and removed the body parts of the Jewish people, and also didn’t spare the elders and the children. The attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorists marks one of the most brutal attacks in history. After the attack by Hamas, Israel launched a counter-attack on Gaza last week. Ministry of Health in Gaza has reported over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including over 2,000 children and 1,100 women as well as journalists, medical workers, and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

90,25-Oct-23,"Congress-owned paper National Herald spreads hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai, terms their vegetarianism as ‘food terrorism’","This article in the Congress mouthpiece comes from the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. On Tuesday (24th October), Sujata Anandan – the editor of the fraud-accused Congress mouthpiece National Herald – spread hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai. In her article published in the Congress mouthpiece, she called the vegetarianism of Jains and Gujaratis in Mumbai “food terrorism”. Sharing her article on X, Sujata Anandan posted, “Go back to Gujarat if you don’t like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own state.”Go back to Gujarat if you don't like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own statehttps://t.co/UgXZMnU9q9In her article titled ‘Dietary apartheid: Mumbai gets a taste of food terrorism’, Sujata Anandan wrote, “Fish and rice are the staple of Maharashtrians and they don’t see why they should give up their diet to please later settlers, like the Gujaratis who hate even the smell of fish.”Villifying Gujaratis in her article, she described various incidents of what she called food terrorism and accused Gujaratis and Jains in Mumbai of targetting Marathis over food habits. She added, “In an incident in a Mumbai suburb, the Gujaratis were even more aggressive—they started dumping garbage at the doors of the Maharashtrian residents, even dog poop and cow dung. The majority of society in this case backed them up, completely ostracising the family and forcing the Maharashtrians out of the building.”She added, “This kind of food terrorism began in the late 1980s, when former prime minister Morarji Desai forced the shutdown of a non-vegetarian restaurant on the ground floor of his building, claiming that the odours disturbed his tranquillity.”In the guise of batting for the so-called just rights of Marathis in Mumbai, what Sujata Anandan peddled was nothing but an agenda to divide Hindus along various caste lines and regional identities. She wrote, “Social media posts by young Maharashtrians have been raging against the Shethjis and Bhatjis – Gujarati traders and priests – and calling to banish them from Mumbai and Maharashtra! Former Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad of the Nationalist Congress Party pointed out that the Kolis (fishermen), the Agris (who built Mumbai for the British) and the upper-crust Pathare Prabhus (who gave the city a cultural mooring) are the original inhabitants of Mumbai.”Notably, it is the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. She had also posted that the armed forces of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj would loot and rape people. A case was filed against her in the Santa Cruz police station in Mumbai, based on the complaint filed by BJP leader Nitesh Rane. Now, to widen the social divide among Hindu communities, she has resorted to furthering the hatred against Jains, Gujaratis and other upper-caste Hindus calling their vegetarianism food terrorism. In the guise of presenting a case for non-vegetarian sections of the Marathi community, she is creating a social divide between the people of different communities living in Mumbai, by calling out particular castes and communities consuming vegetarian food as food terrorists.

91,24-Oct-23,"‘Did you remove diya because it was non-Islamic’: Arfa Khanum Sherwani gets slammed for tweet on Dusshera, others wonder if tweet was ‘Danish Kaneria effect’","It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.On Tuesday, the Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani who peddles the leftist, Islamist agenda was slammed by netizens for editing a post she posted on the occasion of Dussehra. Sherwani initially tweeted wishing people ‘Happy Dussehra’ and added an emoji of a lamp (diya) which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil. However, she later edited the post and removed the emoji of the lamp. After this, netizens slammed the journalist for editing the post and indicated that she removed the emoji may be because it was a Hindu symbol. One of the users with id @SmokingLiberals commented on the post and questioned, “Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic that? (Did you remove the diya emoji because it was non-Islamic?)” Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic tha? pic.twitter.com/HdN3Cqqo9rMeanwhile, another user also questioned the ‘journalist’ asking about what was the reason behind editing the post and removing the lamp from the original post. “Diya kyu hataya (why did you remove diya?” asked one @ShrivastavAni as he thanked former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria for challenging the ‘journalist’ into praising the Indian culture the other day. Diya 🪔 kyon hataya ? Anyways thank you @DanishKaneria61 pic.twitter.com/WS0CCV2UCL“बस कर पगली …..” – @DanishKaneria61P.S. “🪔” delete kyon kiya?? pic.twitter.com/PcXkZLM7TvHowever, others indicated that this was the first time the ‘journalist’ had posted something aligned with the Hindu festival. They also indicated that this was because of Danish Kaneria who challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet on October 23 to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.The saga began after Sherwani accused the Indian cricket fans of supposedly displaying ‘majoritarianism’ during the 2023 World Cup. Danish Kaneria then asked The Wire ‘journalist’ to leave India if she had issues with her Indian entity. Sherwani however accused Kaneria of posting communal trolls against her. After a series of tweet spat between the duo Kaneria then lashed out at Arfa Khanum Sherwani and said, “Let’s end the debate with a single answer – Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” I am not taking about conversion, majoritarianism, Hindus, Indian Muslims or religion. I am simply talking about your ‘loyalty’. Got it? Let’s end the debate with single answer — “Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” https://t.co/xtuZ06RL0KA day after this, Sherwani who probably never exchanged wishes on any Hindu festival, who believes that saying ‘Bharat Mata ki Jay’ is communal and a majoritarian slogan, wished on Dusshera tweeting, “Happy Dusshera”. While the tweet seemed to shock many of her Islamist followers, others slammed her for editing the lamp (diya) emoji from the tweet, which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil on the Hindu festivals.

92,25-Oct-23,"Anti-Israel open letter by sociologists could be signed by anyone using any name, vandalism using Nazi names including Hitler now removed","As anyone could sign the open letter using any name, there is no way to know if someone signed multiple times using different names.The Hamas terror attack on Israel and the subsequent military action in Gaza by Israel has exposed how antisemitism runs deep among Islamists and left-liberals. This has been seen in massive anti-Israel and pro-Palestine protests across Europe and North America, where the Hamas terror attack is being contextualised by blaming Israel.Amid this, an open letter by around 2000 ‘Sociologists’ has emerged, where professors and students of various universities have come together in solidarity with Gaza and Palestinians. In the letter, the signatories accused Israel of genocide, claimed that Israeli officials used ‘dehumanising language’ for Hamas terrorists, and tried to contextualise and justify the horrific Hamas terror attack in Israel on 7 October.Many sociologists who have signed the letter have used social media platforms to urge others to sign the same. Several Indian names can be seen in the list of signatories, which includes Nandini Sundar, wife of The Wire founder Siddharth Varadarajan. Professions, research scholars and students in various universities and colleges across the world appear as signatories of the open letter. Names of several elite universities appear in the list, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Brown, Berkeley etc.The Open Letter was published as a public document on Google Docs, and anyone could sign it, using any name, using the Google Forms feature. While it ensured that the letter got a large number of signs, it also meant that it was vandalised by some people. This was evident in some of the names that appeared as signatories.The most prominent name that appeared in the letter was Adolf Hitler, a clear sign of vandalism. The name appeared as Adolf Hitler, professor emeritus, Sociology, University of Austria. Although Hitler was born in Austria, he was not a professor at any stage of his life, as he never studied beyond secondary education.Hamas Has Adolf Hitler's Endorsement Alongside 1,700 Prominent Sociologists pic.twitter.com/IcCuE6xS9NAnother such seemingly fake name in the list is Dr. Josef Mengele, which is the name of an infamous SS officer and doctor better known as “Angel of Death”, because of the deadly experiments he had conducted on the prisoners at the at the Auschwitz II concentration camp.The sociologists who published the open letter calling for the public to ""contextualize"" Hamas terror accepted and then removed ""Dr. Josef Mengele"" as a signatory. Good work, academic sociologists! 👏 https://t.co/1EqYJZhvUu pic.twitter.com/0FcvafQeQ8Josef Mengele’s name appeared as Dr. Josef Mengele, University of Munich, which is technically correct as he received his PhD from the University of Munich. He did his preliminary medicine education at the University of Bonn and did his MD at University of Frankfurt.After such unusual names were discovered by netizens and posted on social media, it seems the people who created the document started a clean-up job. The problematic names are now gone, which means the moderators have removed the obviously fake names, including Hitler and Mengele.It also seems that the signing of the letter has been restricted now, and someone is verifying the names before they are added to the list of signatories. Although the Goole Form to sign the open letter is still available, submitting a name there does not result in the automatic addition of the name to the list, as was the case earlier. As a result, while the number of signatories was gradually increasing earlier, now it is stuck at 1922.However, such moderation was not present in the open letter earlier, which allowed people to add any name they wanted. This means, there is no way to know if someone signed multiple times using different names.In the meanwhile, Israeli sociologists have written a letter in response to the pro-Hamas open letter, urging them to withdraw the letter. They said the lack of recognition for a tragic event and one-sided perspective was presented in the open letter.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

93,23-Oct-23,"Pakistani Professor forced to apologise for teaching Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, declare ‘women inferior to men’: What Islam says about Evolution","Sher Ali was forced to state that women are inferior to men ""in terms of wisdom as specified by Sharia and that unnecessary interaction of women with men is not acceptable."" In a bizarre turn of events, a biology assistant professor from Bannu, Pakistan was forced to apologize on stamp paper for teaching Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. He was also forced to declare that ‘women are inferior to men’ as per Quran and Hadith.  The professor has been identified as Assistant Professor Sher Ali of the Government Postgraduate Degree College. He was compelled to apologize for teaching Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution which is an elementary subject in biology. In addition, he was also made to denounce mixed-gender sessions and assert that ‘women are inferior to men’. In a three-page document, Assistant Professor Sher Ali pledged to the Bannu deputy commissioner’s office that “all scientific and rational ideas that are in conflict with Islamic Sharia, including Darwin’s theory of evolution, are falsehood.” Sher Ali further was forced to state that women are inferior to men “in terms of wisdom as specified by Sharia and that unnecessary interaction of women with men is not acceptable.” Reports mention that Sher Ali has obtained an MSc from the University of Peshawar and an MPhil in human genetics from Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.The incident came to the fore after the video of the said event went viral on social media. The video was shared by Harris Sultan, author of the book The Curse of God: Why I Left Islam on X, formerly known as Twitter. “This is why Pakistan will remain a third-world hell hole. These radical Muslims with handsome beards force a University professor Sher Ali, to condemn the Theory of Evolution and say on record that women are ‘intellectually inferior’ to men as per the Quran and hadith,” Sultan wrote on X. The clerics are not wrong though. The Quran and the most feminist man of all time, Prophet Muhammad did say ""Women are stupid"". Bukhari 2658For a woman to support Islam is like a black man support KKK. pic.twitter.com/EJnKMKS2BmThe issue surrounding Assistant Professor Sher Ali emerged earlier this month when he spoke at a lecture on women’s rights in light of the Constitution and the law in the Domel area. His remarks during the conference weren’t received well with local religious leaders, who accused him of “spreading debauchery and speaking against Islam and local culture”. They also demanded that authorities take strong measures against the Professor. Shortly thereafter, Ali clarified his opinion on teaching Darwin’s theory of evolution which has been incorporated into the educational system. “Chapter 24 of the biology textbook discusses Darwin’s theory of biological evolution and if someone has problems with this topic, then they should approach the government for the removal of the chapter from the course,” he was quoted as saying. The professor also stated that if he did not teach this material, his learners would question his teaching competence and that he always taught Darwin’s theory of biological evolution after obtaining permission from his students.When evolution is mentioned in Islam, it is inevitably associated with Darwinism and, in most situations, is deemed blasphemy. Previous surveys found that at least three-quarters of Muslims oppose the idea entirely or have basic concerns with it, and they frequently refuse to have the evolution theory taught in Muslim societies. These Muslims intend to restrict Muslim minds by creating confusion and ignorance against the theory of evolution. It was the strategy of Muslim scholars and scientists who contested evolution before Darwin. Most notable among them was Al-Jahiz. He detected traces of evolution and adaptability in some animal species without resorting to anti-theistic arguments in his magnum work, The Book of Animals (Kitab Al-Hayawan).As per the reports, the first encounter with Darwin’s theory in the Muslim world emerged in the year 1876 through specific ideological avenues among Muslim intellectuals. Notably, some Muslims believed in the theory and saw it as the only way to save Muslims from backwardness. However, several Muslim ‘reformists’ then, particularly Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, launched a stinging rebuttal to Darwin’s theory in his Al-Radd ‘ala al-Dahriyyin (Refutation of the Materialists), in which he misrepresented Darwin’s theories. He targeted not the Islamists, but the minds who were advocates of Westernisation of the Muslim world. Similarly, the controversial Turkish writer Harun Yahya today has largely moulded the terminology that dominates debates on evolution. He claims that evolution is opposed to Islam since it promotes atheism. Apart from this, there are many religious scholars who deny the theory of evolution based on ‘their religious understandings’ obtained from the ‘religious books’. Also, famous Muslim televangelist, Zakir Naik dismisses evolution as “just a theory,” confusing the term’s popular and scientific connotations. This conflation helps strengthen the language gulf between the religious and scientific groups.It is important to note in the case of evolution that the Quran specifically mentions Adam’s creation as a wondrous creation. It asserts that the human lineage is traced back to him and that Islam is the oldest of all the religions. The mention of Adam is also made in the religious Islamic texts which describe the ‘father of humankind’ as the one chosen by Allah to begin the prophethood on this Earth. Reports mention that the Nine Surahs of the Quran include 25 mentions of the name Adam. Adam has been referred to in Islamic Hadiths as Abul Bashar (the father of humanity), Khalifatullah (God’s representative or vicegerent), and Safi Allah (the one chosen by God).Verse 4 of Surah At-Tin in the Quran mentions that Allah has created man in his best possible capabilities and that humans are the only ones after whose creation God has praised Himself.Muslims believe that Islam is the oldest religion of all religions and that Adam was the first to appear on this land. They believe that he was the first to begin the chain of humanity. There are several mentions of Adam in the Hadith as well which say that Adam was created out of the different colours of mud which signifies people with different skin colours and different mentalities. The Islamic texts further state that God sent Adam to the Biblical Garden of Eden or Garden of God, also known as Terrestrial Paradise when he was hungry and there he created Eve out of the material of air. God then forbade the duo to taste the fruit of immortality and condemned them to ‘live and die’.The Garden of Eden has been mentioned in the Quran as Al-Jannah, which is the commonly used word for paradise in Islam. The book named ‘Islamic Theory of Evolution: The Missing Link Between Darwin and the Origin of Species’ written by TO Shanavas states that Muslims in the Quran are told that the Garden of Eden was paradise itself and that it was located on the Earth. However, it is for Muslims not to be concerned with the exact location of the garden.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

94,23-Oct-23,Ahmedabad emerges as strong bidder for hosting 2036 Olympics: Know all about how the city is preparing for the games,"The 'Olympics', the world's most popular sporting event. As of 2036, it will have been a considerable stretch since the last Olympics took place in Asia. Notably, Beijing hosted the Olympics in 2008, while Tokyo was the host in 2020. Looking ahead, with Paris set for 2024, Los Angeles for 2028, and Brisbane for 2032, the International Olympic Committee is likely to turn its attention to Asia, with India being a prospective candidate. On 14th October, while addressing the 141st International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Mumbai, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India will leave no stone unturned in the efforts to host the Olympics in 2036. PM Modi said, “India is eager to organise the Olympics in the country, there will be no deficiency in the efforts to ensure that the Olympics are organised in India in 2036.”“This is a years-old dream of 140 crore Indians, it is their desire, and we want to fulfil this dream with the cooperation of all of you,” the Prime Minister said addressing the IOC members. This was seen as an important confirmation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India is bidding to host the 2036 Olympics. And when it comes to imagining which Indian city tops the race for hosting the biggest sporting event on the planet, Ahmedabad is the name that appears naturally, thanks to the world-class sports facility developed in the city over the last few years. It, therefore, becomes important to take an account of the preparations of the prime Gujarati city to host the Olympics in 2036.The ‘Olympics’, the world’s most popular sporting event.

With India being the most populous country in Asia, preparations have already begun. Ahmedabad and Delhi are under consideration as potential host cities, alongside a few other cities for some additional events.About eighteen months before Narendra Modi’s public announcement regarding the possibility of hosting the Olympics in India, Narinder Batra, the President of the Indian Olympic Committee, disclosed in February 2022 that India was actively vying to be the host for the 2036 Olympics. Alongside this, he shared additional specifics. 🇮🇳 The IOC Session will go back to India 40 years after its 86th edition, in New Delhi.It is hoped that hosting the #IOCSession in India will highlight the role of sport in the country and celebrate the contribution of India to the Olympic Movement.https://t.co/zh6eAH0mmXNotably, in a show of support for India, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) arranged its annual meeting of full membership in Mumbai for 2023. Recently concluded, the meeting witnessed Prime Minister Modi expressing India’s ambitions to host the games, widely interpreted as the initiation of India’s lobbying efforts for the bid.Ahmedabad initiated preparations for the 2036 Olympic Games a significant time ago. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has been consecutively undertaking projects that will contribute to the advancement of these initiatives.In preparation for the 2036 Olympic Games in Ahmedabad, progress is underway across three key areas viz Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave, Naranpura International Sports Complex, and Riverfront Sports Complex. These three projects constitute the focal point of Ahmedabad’s endeavours to host the Olympic Games 2036.The SVP Sports Enclave, sprawled across an extensive 236-acre area, boasts a comprehensive range of 50 sports facilities.

The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave will be a multi-sport destination that will provide the infrastructure for hosting national and international sporting events.The planned development of the SVP Sports Enclave anticipates a sprawling built-up area spanning 9,300,000 square feet. The entire project, estimated at a total cost of Rs. 4600 crore, involves a significant governmental investment of Rs. 3200 crore, supplemented by a potential PPP/private investment of Rs. 1400 crore. Notably, the project is strategically structured for phased development, with substantial progress already accomplished. The envisioned enclave stands as a unique entity, providing venues suitable for over 20 different competing events in the Olympic Games.Among the notable features of the SVP Sports Enclave is a 50,000-seat athletics stadium equipped with a standard 400-meter track catering to both track and field events as well as football matches.

95,20-Oct-23,"‘Samdhi, bhai, and the jilted ex’: Know what Mahua Moitra is alluding to in her statement that brings a ‘saas-bahu’ style drama to the whole affair"," Cyril Shroff is the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and Shardul Shroff, who is accused of giving unverified allegations against Adani to Mahua Moitram, is the bhai or brother of Cyril ShroffDays after BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to the Lok Sabha speaker seeking a probe against TMC MP Mahua Moitra accusing her of taking luxury gifts for asking questions in Lok Sabha, things have rapidly escalated for the West Bengal politician. First, it was revealed that Dupey’s allegations were based on information provided to him by advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, former partner of Mohua Moitra.After that, the statement by Dehadrai appeared in public, giving detailed accounts of the allegations against Moitra. He said that Mahua Moitra received expensive gifts and other benefits from business tycoon Darshan Hiranandani, in exchange for asking questions in parliament targeting Gautam Adani, Hiranandani’s business rival in several sectors.It was also alleged that Mahua Moitra had provided her Lok Sabha portal’s login credentials, allowing him to post questions directly on her behalf. While the TMC MP had denied the charges, things exploded on 19 October, when Darshan Hiranandani himself issued a statement, confirming the allegations. He confirmed that he was given Mahua Moitra’s Parliament login and password to post questions. Hiranandani also confirmed that he had given luxury gifts to Moitra, paid for her holidays and travels, helped her in renovating her house etc.The real estate tycoon said that Mohua Moitra chose to target Gautam Adani to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as there was nothing to target the PM directly. Adding to the allegations, Darshan Hiranandani alleged that Mahua Moitra was getting unverified information from several people to target Adani. He specifically mentioned three names, Sucheta Dalal, Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff. Here, Sucheta Dalal is a well-known journalist, while Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff are advocates.Mahua Moitra has issued a statement in response to Hiranandani’s statement, alleging that he was forced to issue the statement by putting a gun to his head. However, she didn’t refute charges that she had given him her Lok Sabha login ID and password and also didn’t deny getting gifts from him and asking questions based on his inputs. She added that Cyril Shroff, brother of Shadul Shoff mentioned by Hiranandani, is the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and the two brothers had a bitter separation of the business. Before mentioning this Samdhi and his Bhai (brother), Moitra had also mentioned her ‘jilted-ex’. Here are the concerned persons and their links to the entire story.Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff are lawyers, and they run one of the largest law firms in India, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. Shardul Shroff is the Executive Chairman and his wife Pallavi Shroff is the Managing Partner of the law firm, and interestingly, they have an Adani connection. Especially, they were in a bitter fight with Shardul’s brother over the law firm, and that brother is a relative of Gautam Adani.Shardul Shroff and his brother Cyril Shroff were managing partners of Amarchand Mangaldas & Suresh A Shroff & Co, a top law firm. However, there was a rivalry between the two brothers over the firm, and they decided in 2015 to split the company. They reached a settlement following mediation and decided that they would split the law firm established in 1917 by their grandfather.The dispute was the result of the will by their mother Bharati Shroff, who had handed over her entire share in the law firm to Shardul Shroff. Shardul Shroff had moved the Delhi High Court seeking implementation of the will, triggering a bitter war between the brothers.However, they finally decided to settle the matter by signing a Family Framework Agreement. According to this agreement, the shares of their mother were divided equally between them. As a result of the settlement, Cyril Shroff chose to not contest the implementation of the will, and Shardul Shroff chose to not go ahead with the lawsuit seeking implementation of the will.Accordingly, Shardul Shroff now runs Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, while Cyril Shroff runs Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, India’s largest full-services law firm. Now that Darshan Hiranandani has accused Shardul Shroff and his wife Pallavi Shroff of helping Mahua Moitra in the campaign against Gautam Adani by feeding unverified information, it becomes interesting to note that Shardul’s brother Cyril is related to Gautam Adani.Paridhi Shroff is the daughter of Cyril Shroff and his lawyer wife Vandana Shroff. Paridhi is married to Karan Adani, the elder son of Gautam Adani. Therefore, Gautam Adani and Cyril Shroff are Samdhis, the Hindi word for fathers of spouses.Karan Adani married Paridhi Shroff in a high-profile wedding ceremony in 2013, which was attended by several well-known guests including Mukesh Ambani and Anand Mahindra. Paridhi Shroff is also a lawyer and is a partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.Given the proximity of Cyril Shroff’s family with Adani and also with his brother, it is possible that Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff had obtained information about the Adani group through Cyril’s firm, which then they passed on to Mahua Moitra.Hence, there are several people involved in the story involving the ‘gift for questions’ charges against Mahua Moitra. There is Cyril Shroff, the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and Shardul Shroff, who is the bhai or brother of Cyril Shroff.There is also a ‘jilted-ex’ in the story, who is none other than advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, who unfolded the entire scam. Mahua Moitra has described him as her ‘jilted ex’, acknowledging their previous relationship. She alleged that the allegations against her were based on lies of a ‘jilted ex’.There is also a dog in the story, named Henry. Apparently, both Mahua Moitra and Jai Anant Dehadrai are claiming ownership of this pet dog. Dehadrai has alleged that he had bought the dog, and now his ex Mahua Moitra has stolen it. He has even written to the Delhi police, seeking to get the Rottweiler dog back from the TMC MP. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

96,19-Oct-23,"Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza Strip: Ideology, activities, and role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict","Hamas' attack on Israel on 7th October 2023 brought both terrorist organisations on their toes as Israel retaliated with full might. Notably, while Hamas led the multifaceted assault on Israel, which included land, sea, and air components, PIJ took an active part in the assault, taking dozens of Israelis hostage.Harakat al-Jihad al-Islami al-Filastini, which is better known as Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) or the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, is the second-largest terrorist organisation operating in the Palestinian territories. It primarily operates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. PIJ came into existence in 1981. It represents a later generation of Palestinian terrorist groups. Founded in the Gaza Strip, the primary goal of PIJ was to “liberate historical Palestine” using armed struggle and by “appealing to the Islamic heritage of the region”.PIJ separates itself from the other earlier generations of Palestinian Islamist groups, such as Fatah and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), as it is mainly influenced by the Islamist ideology of armed liberation rather than internal reform. The founders of PIJ, particularly Fathi-al-Shiqaqi, were linked to the infamous Muslim Brotherhood. Shiqaqi and others believed reviving Islamic rule over the Holy Land of Jerusalem was essential. Other Islamist groups mainly focused on internal reform rather than the so-called armed liberation. Shiqaqi was assassinated in 1995. PIJ stresses the importance of bringing the Islamic front together to “liberate Palestine” and bring Islamic rule back in the region. It generally rejects the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and refuses to participate in the elections held by the PA. Going against the PA’s efforts, PIJ emphasised bringing the Islamic community together while acknowledging the diversity among the Islamic movements, including Sunni, Shi’a, Salafi, and Sufi. While the world leaders have extended support to Palestine via a two-state solution, PIJ has categorically rejected it and insisted the entire historic region of Palestine should be brought back under Islamic Rule.PIJ started to expand its presence in the early 2000s. During 2000-2005, there was a period of heightened unrest between Israel and the Palestinian movement. PIJ established its significant presence in the West Bank in those years with hubs in Jenin and the Gaza Strip. During that time, PIJ became the second most potent terrorist organisation operating in Gaza after Hamas.After Hamas’s takeover and Israel’s blockade, PIJ pushed Hamas to engage in military activities to resist the blockade placed in Gaza. The pressure imposed by PIJ on Hamas was reportedly so intense that Hamas followed suit and indulged in armed conflict with Israeli forces. PIJ proved its importance in the area and managed to have an indirect influence on the public policy of Gaza under the de facto ruler, which was Hamas.In the early 2010s, PIJ expanded its presence into “social services” in Gaza. The aim was to offer an alternative for Hamas to the people of Palestine. PIJ kept running its propaganda under the curtain of becoming the voice of the Palestinians and increased its visibility, challenging the dominance of Hamas in the region. While PIJ and Hamas were sort of rivals for dominance in the region, as time passed by, they formed an unwritten modus vivendi or an agreement of existing together in the region. This was the period when Israel started to notice the increasing dominance of PIJ and attacked it directly.Israel and the United States both consider Hamas and PIJ terrorist organisations. They both share a common ground when it comes to acting against Israel. There is ample evidence that the two terrorist organisations have collaborated and launched joint operations to coordinate military activities in Gaza. However, there have been reports that they often lock horns, especially when there are calls for de-escalation in conflict with Israel.The United States and Israel have designated PIJ as a terrorist organisation due to its violent tactics and objectives in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These designations have implications for regional cooperation.PIJ is mainly backed by Iran, which has provided significant funding and weapons to the terrorist organisation, making it an instrument of Iranian policy in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The financial support from Iran has fluctuated over the years, influenced by the PIJ’s willingness to align with Iran’s broader regional interests. Apart from Iran, it also gets support from Syria and the Lebanese terrorist organisation Hezbollah. Tensions between PIJ and Israel have escalated from time to time over the years. There have been several rocket attacks and airstrikes, leading to violent cycles and casualties on both sides. PIJ’s emphasis on military confrontations and its association with Iran have contributed to its clashes with Israel.Palestinian terrorist groups, including PIJ, have been known to launch rocket attacks that sometimes result in harm to civilians and property. Such incidents underscore the challenges and complexities of asymmetric conflicts where innocent civilians are often caught in the crossfire. It is in sync with the latest incident where a malfunctioned rocket fell on a hospital in Gaza.In recent times, Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7th October 2023 brought both terrorist organisations on their toes as Israel retaliated with full might. Notably, while Hamas led the multifaceted assault on Israel, which included land, sea, and air components, PIJ took an active part in the assault, taking dozens of Israelis hostage. The coordination between the two terrorist organisations showed the evolving dynamics of their military aspects and ability to launch attacks inside Israeli territory. Israel and Hamas war entered the 12th day on 19th October. On 17th October, a rocket fell on the Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital in Gaza. The local media working in Gaza ran reports based on Hamas’ claims that it was an Israeli rocket and around 500 people died in it. However, as more information came to light, it was clear that the hospital’s parking lot took the hit, and the hospital building was mostly intact. Furthermore, it was revealed that the rocket that fell on the hospital was not shot by Israel but by PIJ, putting the terrorist organisation in the spotlight across mainstream media.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

97,26-Oct-23,Could not convert to Islam to become captain of a cricket team: Danish Kaneria says nothing is above Sanatan Dharma,"Danish Kaneria said that during Inzamam-Ul-Haq's captaincy, he got some support to remain in the team which disappeared after Haq's retirement. On Wednesday (25th October), former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria gave an interview to the TV news channel Aaj Tak detailing his struggles as a Hindu in the Pakistan cricket team. In this interview with journalist Sudhir Chaudhary, Danish Kaneria reiterated his old statements against former captain Shahid Afridi and other Pakistani cricketers. Kaneria accused Pakistani cricketers of religious discrimination against him and of attempts to convert him to Islam. He also praised India, current Indian PM Narendra Modi, and emphasised his commitment to Sanatan Dharma. Danish Kaneria said that he is a staunch Sanatani and he holds Dharma above all. Kaneria said, “First of all, for me, my faith in Sanatan Dharma is above everything. Nothing is above the Sanatan Dharma. Lord Ram is the inspiration of my life. Lord Ram says to raise your voice to uphold the Sanatan Dharma every time. I am doing nothing wrong. I am telling just those things which are happening with people here in Pakistan, and I will keep talking about those things. I will continue to point out the wrongdoings taking place here. There are so many cases which go unreported, and these things are happening wide open in front of everybody.”Danish Kaneria added, “I am a Sanatani. My Dharma teaches me to raise my voice for a Hindu brother of mine and the Hindu community. If Bhagwan has given me the power to speak, I must speak for them. I would like it if everyone like me raised their voice. I will like it more if the Indian media raises a voice for this cause, because a wrong must clearly be called a wrong.”Kaneria further said, “By the grace of Bhagwan, my career was going well and I was doing well. After Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, and Imran Khan, I am the fourth-highest wicket-taker for Pakistan. Inzamam-Ul-Haq is the only person who supported me as a captain, Shoaib Akhtar also revealed it. Others, including Shahid Afridi, have harassed me a lot. They would not dine with me. They would always talk of conversion, but my Dharma is everything for me.”Explaining more about how he was implicated in a spot-fixing case, Danish Kaneria said, “Many big players in the Pakistani team used to ask me to convert to Islam, Shahid Afridi was the main one among those players. I was wrongfully trapped in a false allegation of spot-fixing. Some people are also talking about me accepting those allegations after 8 years. I should make it clear now in front of everyone. The only thing I accepted was that through Mervyn Westfield, I was introduced to a bookie named Anu Bhat when I was playing county cricket alongside him in an English county team.”kaneria added, “Apart from that, they pressured me to accept everything. In fact, I was completely unaware of any details of the fixing thing. However, the other person involved in this scandal was jailed in England. According to a report by Justice Qayyum, he has said that certain people in Pakistan cricket will never be allowed to become big figures.”Danish Kaneria accused the Pakistan Cricket Board of discriminating against him on religious grounds. He said, “I was never backed by our cricket board. Ejaz Bhat or Najam Sethi, nobody helped me, nobody supported me just because I am a Hindu. They knew very well that if I had played for a long time, I would have broken all the records. Once I enter the ground, no one can stop me from taking wickets. That was bound to happen, and they knew that I had the ability to break all those records.”Detailing more on this religious discrimination, Danish Kaneria said, “Do you know a Hindu in the history of Pakistan who rose to higher posts or became the greatest of all in any field ever? India is the only country that has given opportunities to people from all backgrounds. I was so disappointed in those days. As if it was not enough, my father also passed away. After being away for 8 consecutive years, I did not have any job. They finished me, but I believed in Bhagwan who always inspired me to be truthful. So, I agreed to just the fact that I was introduced to a person – nothing more than that. I did this in the hope that I would get an opportunity again if I spoke the truth.”Pointing out the difference between the treatment given to players in the Indian cricket team and those in the Pakistani cricket team, Danish Kaneria said, “Players like Sharjeel Khan, who were actually caught and convicted in spot-fixing, were all brought back by the PCB but they do not support Danish Kaneria because he is a Hindu. This is not the case with India. India is an integrated country and people living in India have a very good bond with each other. For example, when Mohammad Shami was heavily trolled during a tournament, it was Virat Kohli who stepped in his support first of all. Virat Kohli answered the trollers saying ‘he is my teammate’.”Kaneria further said, “You cannot show one such example in the Pakistani Cricket Team where someone has leveled accusations against me and some other player in the team stood up to back me. Shoaib Akhtar is the only exception. In Indian cricket team, all players are treated equally. They get so much respect and love. It is not just about Shami. You take the examples of Siraj, Irfan Pathan, Yousuf Pathan, and even Mohammad Azaharuddin. Even Mohammad Azaharuddin’s ban was also lifted after a period.”Danish Kaneria also accused the Pakistani cricketers of abusing Hindu deities. He said, “Whatever I have faced in the Pakistani Cricket Team is horrific. They hurled religious abuses at me. They abused my deities. They asked me to convert to Islam. All I was thinking was that I should perform better. I would think that only my performance can be the key to ensuring a place in the team. There were also so many players who were in the team despite not performing. On the other hand, people in India are educated, and cultured. They respect each other. On the other hand, Pakistani cricketers need to learn the lesson of ‘live and let others live too’.”Danish Kaneria said that during Inzamam-Ul-Haq’s captaincy, he got some support to remain in the team which disappeared after Haq’s retirement. He said, “For most of the years of my career, I played under the captaincy of Inzamam-Ul-Haq. I would get conversion calls from fellow players even during his tenure but he would advise me to focus on my game and ignore these things. I would get a call every day to join for the morning Namaz. One day I strictly told them that I should not be called for the morning Namaz hereafter. After Inzamam retired, the discrimination increased. One day, I realised that they just wanted to expel me out of the team by hook or crook.”On the current Pakistani cricket team offering Namaz on the ground, taking stands on political issues, and backing Hamas terrorists in Gaza, Danish Kaneria said, “This team is prioritising the religion. Secondly, they are into politics. Cricket is on the third spot in their priority list. In fact, cricket should have been their first priority and they are ignoring that. No wonder we are seeing such results. I don’t understand why they do a show-off by offering Namaz in front of all on the ground. They may just pray inside the dressing room for a while. We too believe in our deities. Do we all start pooja and aarti in the ground itself after taking a wicket? But they have a certain mindset. They want to show-off all these things. Virat Kohli does puja, doesn’t he? Doesn’t Rohit Sharma do puja? Doesn’t Shami offer Namaz? Doesn’t Siraj offer Namaz? They do all this, but not on the playground.”On the Pakistani cricket team blaming BCCI and the Indian audience for the defeats in the World Cup, Danish Kaneria said, “Why do Pakistani cricketers want to show the world what they are? They should focus on cricket. They have a coach who asks why the ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ song was not played instead of ‘Jai Shri Ram’. First of all, I would like to tell him what is meant by ‘Jai Shri Ram’. It is a greeting. People welcome you by saying it. They are not starting any jihad by saying ‘Allah Hu Akbar’.”Explaining more on Jai Shri Ram, Danish Kaneria said, “All they are saying is that the path shown by Lord Ram is a good path and one should follow it. Glory to Lord Ram. It is the way people are greeting each other. It is not a call to fight. You are a coach, talk about cricket. You talk of ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ in a press conference. You talk about the BCCI event. Was it a BCCI event in the games against Australia, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh? Pakistani cricket team should talk about cricket only. They should think why 8 players were dismissed for just 33 runs. They do other things just to keep their shops running.”On getting citizenship in India, Danish Kaneria said, “I congratulate Narendra Modi Ji for the way he is working. He does fast-paced development. Recently, the Chandrayaan was also a grand success and I congratulate him for all these achievements. India’s economy is also on a very positive track. I have always said that it is not a question of nationality. If I am given Indian nationality, I would happily take it.”Kaneria said, “Had I become a Muslim, I would not have faced this problem in my career. Maybe I would have become the captain of the Pakistani cricket team. Maybe I would have broken all the records of bowling from Pakistan, but converting to Islam just for the sake of this? I cannot think of it in the wildest of my dreams. It is impossible for me to degrade to this level.” Talking more about his faith in Sanatan Dharma, Danish Kaneria said, “I am a hardcore Sanatani. I follow Sanatan Dharma. I love Sanatan Dharma and it is everything for me. It is okay if I don’t get any job. I will tell everyone that they should not compromise on Dharma. If there is Dharma, then there can be all other things in life. Without Dharma, one gets nothing. I was told so many things. I was promised so many things in exchange for conversion. All I told them was ‘Jai Shri Ram’.”When asked if he wants to see Pakistan winning this World Cup or India becoming the champions, Danish Kaneria said, “It will be a big achievement for the Pakistani cricket team even if they get a spot in the top 4 teams, forget about becoming the champions. Right now they are relying on other teams to get in the top four. They are praying for some team’s victory and some other team’s defeat to get there. I don’t see them performing well even in the upcoming matches. They are yet to play against England which will be a pressure game. On the other hand, India is a very balanced team. They look rock solid and they are the favourite ones to win this world cup”When asked about Danish Kaneria getting online attacks by Indians like Arfa Khanum Sherwani and a recent response by BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia, he said, “I think Indians who troll me are probably not honest to themselves and their religion. They should be honest to the party they represent. Their party works for Dharma with honesty. They should think before saying anything. They should think first about who are they targeting. They should have this much knowledge. I won’t comment on any of their internal political matters, but call me out if I am wrong. If I am not wrong, then you should not try to prove me wrong.” He added, “They should understand that I am raising my voice for Dharma. You going against me looks very sad. People know the truth. They judge the things. I don’t pay attention to that. It can be his (Gaurav Bhatia’s) belief, but he should introspect. He should see that I am doing this for a cause, for Sanatan Dharma.”Danish Kaneria was born on December 16, 1980, in Karachi, Pakistan. The leg spinner represented the Pakistani national cricket team in both Test and One Day International (ODI) matches. He made his Test debut on November 29, 2000, against England in Faisalabad, ultimately participating in 61 Test matches for Pakistan. Throughout his Test career, he secured an impressive total of 261 wickets, with best figures of 7/77 in an innings and best match figures of 12/94. He claimed 15 five-wicket hauls and 2 ten-wicket hauls during his career.

98,25-Oct-23,"Shraddha Kapoor, who protested against the metro car shed in Aarey, buys a diesel-guzzling Lamborghini worth Rs 4 crores","Shraddha Kapoor, who protested against the metro car shed in Mumbai's Aarey Colony in 2019 in a call to save the environment, is now all set to flaunt this diesel-guzzling Lamborghini worth Rs 4.04 crores, whose mileage is said to be a paltry 6-7 kmpl. On Tuesday (24th October), Bollywood star Shraddha Kapoor purchased a sleek red Lamborghini Huracan Tecnica, adding to her car collection on the occasion of Dussehra. Images of the actress posing with her new possession have been making rounds on various social media platforms. A post shared by Varinder Chawla (@varindertchawla)Shraddha Kapoor, who protested against the metro car shed in Mumbai’s Aarey Colony in 2019 in a call to save the environment, is now all set to flaunt this diesel-guzzling Lamborghini worth Rs 4.04 crores.A post shared by Varinder Chawla (@varindertchawla)Last Wednesday, Shraddha Kapoor was spotted driving her latest acquisition to the renowned ISKCON temple in Juhu, where she performed a puja to mark the beginning of her journey with her new vehicle. During her interaction with the media, she emphasised that the vehicle is not just a car to her, but a chariot.The online community responded with strong criticism towards Bollywood star Shraddha Kapoor for her recent addition of this vehicle to her fleet. This backlash comes in light of her prior protests against the tree-cutting activities in Mumbai’s Aarey Colony for a metro car shed.It is notable that Shraddha Kapoor boasts an impressive collection of luxury cars, comprising the Audi Q7, Mercedes-Benz ML, Mercedes-Benz GLA, BMW 7 series, Toyota Fortuner, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Swift, and several others. Her new car Lamborghini Huracan Tecnica has an ARAI-rated fuel efficiency of 7 kilometres per litre of the diesel it consumes. However, in city conditions and considering the traffic in Mumbai, the effective fuel efficiency of the car reduces to 3 to 4 kilometres per litre. Cars earlier owned by the actress are also not so much fuel-economic. Against this backdrop, she received heavy criticism from netizens for her hypocrisy. In October 2019, she argued against cutting off trees and wrote on Instagram, “This is wrong and should not be happening” and “Mumbaikars wake up”. She also reached the protest site wearing a T-shirt on which ‘Save Aarey’ was written. She also flagged posters at the protest site.Criticising the actress, Aparajit Bharat wrote, “Meet climate activist Shraddha Kapoor. She wanted to block the Metro Carshed in Aarey. The Metro was supposed to serve the common working class of Mumbai & ease their travelling hassles. Today, she bought a 4 Cr Lamborghini for herself. Indian version of Greta.”Meet climate activist @ShraddhaKapoor She wanted to block the Metro Carshed in Aarey.

This pattern isn’t unique to Shraddha; it’s a common reality among such page 3 environmentalists. They support causes, not because they truly believe in them or follow them in real life, but for the primary purpose of improving their public image, which, in the process, benefits their primary careers.”Shraddha Kapoor, an environmentalist, was one of the flag bearers of 'Save Aarey' campaign.Recently, She purchased a luxury sports car worth crores. These cars pollute many times more than regular cars due to extremely high power and extremely low mileage.This pattern isn't…The ambitious Mumbai Metro project had planned to relieved the city’s famed congestion and provide people with a mode of quick, safe and cheap transit. By reducing vehicular traffic the metro de-clogs the roads and an independent UNFCC study points to the fact that it shall reduce CO2emission by 2.6 lakh metric tons every year.Aarey is spread over 1278 hectares of land, out which, the metro car shed will be only built on 30 Hectare of Aarey land and even within that, 5 Hectare has been kept intact for greenery. So in a nutshell, only 2% area of the entire Aarey Colony will be utilized for the proposed metro car shed.During the Maha Vikas Aghadi rule, the ambitious Mumbai metro project that sought to enhance connectivity in the financial hub of the country and help millions of daily commuters with another avenue of public transport fell victim to a bunch of ‘environmentalists’ who protested against the construction of a metro car shed at the Aarey site in Goregaon. The protests led to abrupt halting of construction of the metro shed, but it was resumed and completed after Eknath Shinde-Devendra Fadnavis formed government in Maharashtra.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

99,25-Oct-23,"‘Mela’ director says Aamir Khan insisted on doing a vulgar scene in the movie, reveals why Kajol had refused to star opposite the actor","He stated, ""You wouldn't believe this, but there's that urine therapy sequence (in the film) with Johnny Lever. For the first time in my life, I wept on set. I said who will believe this is an Aamir Khan sequence."" However, the Aamir actor told Darshan ""not to be pretentious.""Filmmaker Dharmesh Darshan who gained prominence in the 1990s and 2000s for his work on projects like Dhadkan and Raja Hindustani has shared personal anecdotes from his experience during the making of his movies. Speaking about one of the experiences, the director revealed how Aamir Khan pushed him to shoot a “vulgar scene” and made him weep on the sets of the movie ‘Mela’. Darshan mentioned that when he initially collaborated with Aamir Khan, the actor was viewed as more “elitist” and hadn’t achieved the same level of success in the Hindi mainstream as some of his fellow actors. However, Aamir strove for sequences that contradicted his persona during the production of Mela. The director divulged that after watching the Hollywood movie ‘Dumb and Dumber’, Aamir urged him to replicate a distasteful scene from it. He stated, “You wouldn’t believe this, but there’s that urine therapy sequence (in the film) with Johnny Lever. For the first time in my life, I wept on set. I said who will believe this is an Aamir Khan sequence.” However, the Aamir actor told Darshan “not to be pretentious.” The director said that the scene was obscene, but he performed it despite his reservations because he had committed to the assignment.Here’s the scene from the movie:-Darshan said that the actor wasn’t as dedicated to the movie’s quality as he generally would have been because he was too preoccupied with bringing his brother Faisal Khan’s career back to life. “I didn’t want to do Mela, but Aamir had to correct Faisal’s career. First I said no to him.” Darshan had similar things to say about his venture ‘Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya’ which he said he worked on for emotional reasons and not because he wanted to. However, he consented to direct Mela only at his mother’s persuasion.He added, “Oddly, Aamir didn’t submit so much in Mela. His mind started working more because he was concerned about Faisal. He had become so big after Raja Hindustani, and he doesn’t have that commercial instinct. It became a hodgepodge, but I saved it at the end of the day economically. But I got so much flak for it.”Furthermore, the director disclosed that Kajol was initially considered for the lead for ‘Mela’, which was eventually played by Twinkle Khanna. Darshan revealed that Kajol had refused to star in the film because of Aamir’s reputation for several takes whereas she was a one-take actor.“All my friends had worked with her, but I worked with Lolo (Karisma Kapoor). Kajol was supposed to be in Mela, but there was some discomfort from her side. She was not sure about Aamir at that point, though later on they did Fanaa. She’s a one-take actor, and he takes many takes. So, she had those reservations, that her spontaneity (would be affected). But she was very gracious, she came to my house and explained it to me. Kajol was not known to do these things,” Darshan said.The part was then played by Twinkle Khanna, who has often publicly mocked the film and her own performance during interviews. It was her final film before she tied the knot with Akshay Kumar and decided to quit acting altogether. Mela turned out to be a major box-office disappointment and continues to be one of the most detested films in Aamir Khan’s career. It essentially put an end to Faisal Khan’s Bollywood hopes while Aamir recovered from the failure the very next year with back-to-back hits like Lagaan and Dil Chahta Hai. Dharmesh Darshan went on to direct movies such as Dhadkan, Bewafaa, Haan Maine bhi Pyaar Kiya and Aap ki Khatir in the ensuing years.Watch the entire interview below: Notably, Aamir Khan made headlines in 2021 when it was revealed that the actor used to spit on the hands of his female stars like Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawala in the name of pranks. However, he defended it by claiming, “Whoever actress I spat in the palm of became number one.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

100,24-Oct-23,Afghanistani cricketer Ibrahim Zadran dedicates Man of the Match award to Afghans forcibly deported by Pakistan: Here is what he was talking about,"Zardan was the highest scorer for the winning team in the match. He said, ""I want to dedicate this Man of The Match to those sent from Pakistan to back home in Afghanistan."" On 23rd October, Afghanistan beat Pakistan in the ICC Cricket World Cup match by eight wickets, chasing 285 runs on the board. It was the second-biggest win for Afghanistan in the tournament. Following the match, Ibrahim Zardan was awarded the ‘Man of The Match’ trophy that he dedicated to his fellow countrymen who were forcibly sent back from Pakistan.Tight Slap on Terror sympathizer Pakistani team by Afghan player Ibrahim Zadran🔥– He has dedicated his POTM award to Afghans who were forcibly being sent back from Pakistan to Afghanistan🎯#PAKvsAFG pic.twitter.com/yMKH19GCJwZardan was the highest scorer for the winning team in the match. He said, “I want to dedicate this Man of The Match to those sent from Pakistan to back home in Afghanistan.” With his message, he highlighted the ongoing forced deportation by Pakistan of the Afghans who escaped the war-torn country in August 2021 after the Taliban took over following the departure of American and allied forces.When the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August 2021, around 7,00,000 Afghans fled the country. During American and allied forces’ control over the country, millions of Afghans had already left, as the living conditions in Afghanistan were not favourable. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), around four million Afghans live there. Out of these, around 1.7 million are considered to be illegal residents in Pakistan.A large chunk of the Afghan refugees have taken shelter in the outskirts of Quetta, Pakistan. However, the uncertainty over their living arrangements in the neighbouring country has clouded their day-to-day life following an unexpected announcement from the Pakistani government where they said only those refugees would be allowed to stay who have legal status. The Pakistani government has asked the remaining refugees to leave in 28 days. The ultimatum was given on 6th October, and the deadline is just over a week away.After the announcement, spokesperson of Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mumtaz Zahra Baloch claimed that the policy was not aimed solely to target Afghans. She said, “We have been hosting Afghan refugees generously for the past four decades.” Millions of Afghans had fled the country during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation. “Our policy is only about illegal individuals here illegally, no matter their nationality. But, unfortunately, there has been a misunderstanding or misrepresentation, and for some reason, people have started associating this with Afghan refugees … The laws in Pakistan are similar to laws in many other countries,” she added.Contrary to what she said, reports suggest that thousands of Afghans are facing harassment and detention since the government announced. While the Pakistani government claimed that most of the deportations were happening “voluntarily”, the international human rights organisations accused them of targeting vulnerable individuals. They warned of serious protection risks upon their return. Notably, since the Taliban took over Afghanistan, the country has plunged into a severe humanitarian crisis impacting women’s rights and the rights of the people in general. Furthermore, devastating earthquakes in the country have increased the threat posed to the vulnerable Afghans.A 16th October report in The Guardian suggested that at least 2,600 Afghans were already deported. Notably, it was pointed out that those who have legal refugee status were also living in fear of detention. Furthermore, reports suggest that landlords in Islamabad got notices for eviction and offers for rewards, leading to the arrest of Afghan nationals.Many Afghans have lived in Pakistan for decades and now call it their home. However, the ongoing uncertainty over their refugee status and the possibility of detention and deportation has put a question mark on their future. As Zardan dedicated his award to the vulnerable refugees of Afghanistan, the Pakistani government’s decision to deport Afghans has been brought to the international mainstream media’s attention. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

101,27-Oct-23,‘Fair investigation killed before it began’: Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi accuses DMK govt of not taking action in Raj Bhavan petrol bomb incident," The Raj Bhavan in a press statement released on Thursday, October 26, stated that the police did not register Raj Bhavan's complaint on the October 25th incident where petrol bomb was hurled outside the Raj Bhavan.A war of words has ensued in Tamil Nadu over a petrol bomb being hurled outside the Raj Bhavan in Chennai on 25th October. The Raj Bhavan in a press statement released on Thursday, October 26, stated that the police did not register Raj Bhavan’s complaint on the attack.pic.twitter.com/c0avVP799y“Police did not register Raj Bhavan’s complaint on the attack. Suo Moto diluted the attack as an act of simple vandalism and in a hurry got arrested accused remanded to jail at midnight waking up the magistrate and preventing detailed interrogation which could expose those behind the attack. Fair investigation is killed before it begins,” the statement from Raj Bhavan read.The statement was posted on X, formerly Twitter, tagging the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), and Home Minister’s Office (HMO).This statement came following a detailed press release by the official residence of Governor RN Ravi on 25 October, hours after the attack. It stated that “some miscreants armed with petrol bombs tried to barge into through the main gate no. 1 of the Raj Bhavan”.Press Release No: 71 pic.twitter.com/FofY87mJZO“Even when security personnel of Raj Bhavan attempted to subdue the attacker, another petrol bomb was hurled, which resulted in severe damage to the main entrance to Raj Bhavan. Somehow, one of the assailants was overpowered by the Security,” the statement read.The Raj Bhavan stated that a police complaint was filed to the Commission of Police, Greater Chennai Police, by the Deputy Secretary to the Governor and Comptroller requesting to register a case under section 124 IPC and other relevant provisions of the law.It alleged that there have been threat attempts previously, too, “intended to overawe the Governor and restrain him from discharging his Constitutional duties. However, complaints lodged with the police have been inconsequential due to police inaction”.Recalling an incident on 18th April 2022, the Raj Bhavan alleged in the statement that the Governor was physically attacked with sticks and stones while he was on his way to attend a scheduled function at the Dharmapuram Adhinam. “The complaint was lodged by Raj Bhavan, but the FIR was not registered and no action was taken against the assailants.”In the complaint letter to the police which was attached with the press release, the Raj Bhavan stated that verbal attacks and threats to the Governor have been made mostly by leaders and workers of the DMK and its allies in their public meetings and through their social media.Countering the charges, the Tamil Nadu DGP said that “Raj Bhavan’s statement that the petrol bomb exploded and that the petrol bombs were hurled by more than one person is totally contrary to the truth”.“Also, a statement by the governor’s office that the governor’s convoy was attacked in Mayiladuthirai and the complaint given by the governor’s office and it’s not filed, are also against the truth. Actually, the governor’s convoy was not attacked but his follow-up vehicle was and a case was filed in that incident and 73 persons were arrested,” DGP Shankar Jiwal said.Jiwal said that a fair and complete investigation will be conducted regarding the incident and that all footage from CCTV has been retrieved. The DGP, however, also said that the complaint that more than one person was involved was untrue.On 25th October, a man reportedly hurled a petrol bomb outside the main gate of the Raj Bhavan in Chennai. Initial reports had said that two petrol bombs were hurled, which was later dismissed by the state police.Raj Bhavan was attacked today afternoon. Miscreants carrying bombs tried to barge in through the main gate. However, alert sentries prevented and assailants hurled two petrol bombs inside Raj Bhavan and escaped.@PMOIndia @HMOIndia @PIB_India @DDNewslive @ANI @PTI_NewsThe police had filed a case against the accused, who was reportedly interrogated to determine the motive behind the attack. The accused was identified as a history sheeter named K Vinoth who was involved in an attack on Tamil Nadu BJP headquarters.A case was reportedly registered against him under sections 436, 353, 506(ii) IPC, Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act and Section 4 of the TNPDL Act.The controversy comes at a time when the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government and Governor RN Ravi have been at loggerheads over several administrative issues including MK Stalin government’s anti-NEET bill and appointments to the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) in recent days.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

102,26-Oct-23,8 ex-Indian navy officers sentenced to death by Qatar. Here is what we know about the Indians accused of espionage charges by Qatar Govt,"Qatar's intelligence agency had picked them up from their homes in the middle of the night on August 30. They were put in solitary confinement. On Thursday, October 26, a court in Qatar awarded a death sentence to eight ex-Indian Navy officers. These officers, who were arrested in Doha on August 30, 2022, have been languishing in the Qatar jail for over a year on charges of espionage and spying. The Qatar authorities accused them of spying for Israel.India’s Ministry of External Affairs has reacted strongly to the verdict saying that India is “deeply shocked.” MEA added that it would continue to extend all consular and legal assistance to secure the release of the eight former Indian Navy officers.One of the jailed officers, Commander Purnendu Tiwari (Retd), is the managing director of the firm that was conferred the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award in 2019. The award was handed over by none other than the then-President Ram Nath Kovind. The other detained Indians are Navtej Singh Gill, Birendra Kumar Verma, Sugunakar Pakala, Sanjeev Gupta, Amit Nagpal, Rajesh Gopakumar, and Saurav Vashisht.Qatar’s intelligence agency had picked them up from their homes in the middle of the night on August 30. They were put in solitary confinement. For months after their arrest, the Qatar authorities never specified the charges that had been pressed against them. Only recently did they confirm that the Indian Navy personnel, who were held in solitary confinement for long spells, have been charged with the offence of spying for Israel on the country’s advanced submarines.The Qatar State Security, the state intelligence agency, had claimed that it had intercepted electronic communications establishing that the naval officers were spying on the submarine programme. The agency had, however, not shared the information with India.Reports that the former Indian Navy officers may have been “framed” by Pakistani intelligence agencies surfaced in April of this year. The case of Kulbhushan Yadav, a former commander of the Indian navy who was abducted from Iran and imprisoned in Pakistan on suspicion of spying, is said to have been used by the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI to convince the Qatari authorities against these eight decorated ex-Indian Navy officers.Ever since the officers were taken into custody by the Qatari authorities, the Indian embassy has been doing everything within its power to get them released. They have been helping the family members have frequent visits, and they have been offering the Navy officers legal and consular support. When discussing India’s stance on the eight former Indian Navy officers who were arrested, MEA spokesperson Bagchi emphasized that the Center was doing “everything in its power to support these Indians.”Today, following the announcement of the death penalty, India’s Ministry of External Affairs expressed shock and vowed to explore all available legal options to secure the release of its citizens.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

103,26-Oct-23,BJP questions Mamata Banerjee’s silence on allegations levelled at Mahua Moitra as she defends Minister Jyoti Priya Mallick,"The moment Mamata Banerjee stepped in to defend her cabinet minister Jyoti Priya Mallick, the BJP cornered her for her perceived discrimination against Mahua Moitra.On Thursday, October 26, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) conducted a raid at the residence of West Bengal Minister Jyoti Priya Mallick at Salt Lake in Kolkata for his alleged connection in a case of corruption linked to ration distribution. As ED continues to search the WB Minister’s residence, West Bengal CM and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee lashed at the central agency threatening it with police action if the senior Trinamool leader was harmed in any way.Jyoti Priya Mallick who is currently serving as forest minister in Mamata Banerjee’s government earlier held the food minister portfolio.TMC minister Jyotipriya Mallick unwell, will lodge FIR against BJP if anything happens to him during ED raids: Mamata BanerjeeSpeaking in a press conference at her Kalighat residence Mamata said, “BJP is in engaged in a devious strategy under the guise of ED raids on opposition leaders nationwide ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. It will not help them to win. Jyotipriya Mallick is in poor health. He is suffering from high blood sugar. We will file an FIR against the BJP and the ED if any harm befalls him during searches at his residence.”Referring to the raid at Mallick’s house, Mamata hit out at the BJP by saying, “What atrocities and lawlessness are occurring? BJP is playing a dirty game. I want to know whether they there has been even one such raid at the residence of any BJP leader? Neither they nor we will remain in power forever. New generation will come up to take over. But they are leaving blunders for the next generation.” The moment Mamata Banerjee stepped in to support her cabinet minister, the BJP cornered her for her perceived discrimination against Mahua Moitra, another TMC leader who has recently been under investigation in connection with the cash-for-query scam. Notably, the TMC supremo has not spoken a word in connection with Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra being investigated by the Ethics Committee in the alleged cash-for-query scam.Targeting Trinamool Congress for its stoic silence in Mahua Moitra’s case, the BJP claimed Mahua Moitra has been “abandoned” and that Banerjee’s silence is an admission of her party leader’s guilt.“TMC’s official stand on Mahua Moitra is that “We won’t comment. Said MP will defend herself” Does it mean 1)TMC accepts Mahua Moitra has made serious breaches including giving her log in to be operated from foreign soil by a rival corporate entity in exchange for kickbacks? 2) If so, then why is TMC still retaining her rather than sacking her? 3) Is the TMC afraid of taking this action because the party itself has something to hide? Perhaps people in the party knew or endorsed it? TMC must clarify,” BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonwalla questioned.TMC’s official stand on Mahua Moitra is that “We won’t comment. Said MP will defend herself” Does it mean 1)TMC accepts Mahua Moitra has made serious breaches including giving her log in to be operated from foreign soil by a rival corporate entity in exchange for kickbacks ?…Earlier, senior BJP leader Amit Malviya, who is co-incharge of the party’s Bengal operations, said it was no surprise that Mamata Banerjee has “abandoned” Moitra. The Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha, meanwhile, has called Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra on October 31, over the cash-for-query allegations against her. The decision was taken after the panel held its first meeting today wherein it was concluded that the charges against Moitra are “very serious” and warrant a full investigation.Moitra has been accused of taking Rs 2 crore in cash to ask, in Parliament, questions allegedly designed to target the Adani Group. The enquiry was initiated after BJP MP Nishikant Dubey earlier wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker, alleging the involvement of Mahua Moitra in the ‘Cash for Query’ scandal. He further claimed that he had proof of the charges as given to him by Advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai.The Trinamool Congress has distanced itself from charges facing Moitra. The party said last week it would take an “appropriate decision” after the Ethics Committee inquiry.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

104,26-Oct-23,"Israel-Hamas War: IDF neutralised at least 20 commanders of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah since the war began","A brief ground action by Israeli troops and tanks took place in northern Gaza overnight on 26 October with the intention of ""preparing the battlefield"" for the much-anticipated full-scale ground attack. The conflict between Israel and Hamas started 20 days ago following the gruesome attacks on 7 October by Hamas. Israel has been continuously bombing the Hamas sites in the Gaza Strip as well as Hezbollah’s targets in Lebanon due to which multiple facilities belonging to Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah were destroyed. Furthermore, Israel reported to have eliminated hundreds of terrorists from these organisations. Hezbollah confirmed that 46 of its fighters including all its top commanders have been assassinated in this war so far. On 14 October, Ali Qadhi was killed by the Israeli military. He was the commander of the Nukhba Special Force, a Hamas special military unit and was involved in the planning of the deadly assault on the Jewish state earlier this month. He was arrested by Israeli authorities for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of 51-year-old Israeli businessman Sasson Nuriel but he was released in 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit (Israeli soldier) prisoner exchange.Zakaria Abu Maamar who was a member of Hamas’ political office during the 2020s was killed on 10 October. He lost his life in an Israeli Air Force airstrike on Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip during Operation Iron Swords in 2023. Billal Al Kedra alias Bilal al Qadr who was a senior commander in the Nukhba and involved in the plotting of the 7 October attacks, notably the Kfar Aza, Nirim and Nir Oz massacres was killed. The news about his death first appeared on 14 October which revealed that he was killed in the Khan Yunis area in the southern Gaza Strip on 13 October.

Fortunately, she was saved by the police. The two had met through social media. The accused is a resident of Aurangabad and worked as an auto-mechanic. He befriended the victim on Instagram and took her to many hotels. He reportedly made an account with the name “staunch Muslim” on the social media platform and lured her into his fraudulent love trap. He travelled to Surat along with a friend to meet her and celebrated his birthday with her in a hotel there. Afterwards, he kidnapped her and brought her to Mumbai. The two also visited Ajmer and he stayed with her in multiple hotels during that time. Meanwhile, the victim’s family members protested to the authorities when their daughter went missing from the house for a few days and police started their probe. Two police teams were deployed to Maharashtra in search of them and another youth who helped the offender was caught.The minor’s location was discovered at Ahmedabad’s Kalupur railway station when authorities put her mobile number under surveillance. She was saved after 15 days as a result of a tip-off and the perpetrator was taken into custody by Ahmedabad police after the information was passed on to them by authorities in Surat. He was going back to Maharashtra from Ajmer with her. The police have taken action against him under the Kidnapping and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO) Act based on the victim’s complaint. They were transported to Surat Civil Hospital for medical evaluation and at present both are being questioned by the cops. According to Assistant Commissioner of Police VR Malhotra, the offender in the case is a mechanic who is employed in the garage of his uncle (mother’s brother). He made friends with the girl on social media last year and has been in touch with her ever since. Action has been initiated against him under Sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and 366 (Abducting or inducing a woman to compel her to marry) of the Indian Penal Code and the POSCO Act. The cops have organised for the medical examination of the girl and further sections are going to be imposed if rape is confirmed. The startling occurrence has renewed worries about the threat posed by love jihad in Surat where authorities proclaimed that there has been an increase in instances of this kind recently. About 25 cases of love jihad have been reported in Gujarat in the last five months, the majority of them are from Surat. The case has outraged Hindu outfits in the area and the inquiry is continuing per law. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

106,26-Oct-23,Former MLA and mafia Mukhtar Ansari convicted in a 14-year-old murder case by MP-MLA court in Ghazipur,"It was alleged that Mukhtar Ansari planned a conspiracy to murder Kapil Dev Singh around 14 years ago while he was in jail, the court found him guilty in the caseOn Thursday (26th October), the MP-MLA court in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, declared mafia and former MLA Mukhtar Ansari guilty in a 14-year-old murder case of one Kapil Dev Singh. Ansari was booked under the Gangster Act and was declared guilty by the court as confirmed by Ansari’s lawyer Liyaqat Ali. However, the court will announce the punishment to the guilty on Friday (27th October). Another accused Sonu Yadav was also convicted in the case.According to the reports, a case was registered against Mukhtar Ansari under the Gangster Act in Karanda police station. He was booked in the Kapil Singh murder case and was also accused of launching an attack on one Mir Hasan. While the former MLA was acquitted in the case of an attack on Mir Hasan on 17th May, he has been found guilty in the murder case of Kapil Dev Singh. Ansari was acquitted by courts in both cases in 2011 and 2023, respectively. However, the MP/MLA court of Gazipur found him guilty in the murder case.Kapil Dev Singh was murdered in the Suapur region which falls under the Karanda police station area. It was alleged that Mukhtar Ansari planned a conspiracy to murder Singh around 14 years ago while he was in jail. The Court heard the case today and declared Ansari guilty. For the last more than 15 years, this former ‘lawmaker’ – ill-known more for breaking the laws rather than making one – has been lodged in jail. He contested the elections from jail. He won the elections from jail. He is known for operating his gangs from jail. There are many cases registered against this mafia who became MLA from Mau for the 5th time in 2017. The crimes enlisted in these cases are murder, attempt to murder, armed riots, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation, fraud for property expropriation, interference with public affairs, and willful attack to injure someone.In the 80s, Mukhtar Ansari was involved in a gang war with another mafia Brijesh Singh. He had established his presence till Mau, Jaunpur, Ballia, and Varanasi. Mukhtar Ansari’s name first appeared in the Sachchidanand Rai murder case of 1988. Sachidanand Rai was killed in connection with a land dispute in the Ghazipur district. In this murder case, charges were leveled against Mukhtar Ansari. This was the first time that Mukhtar Ansari’s name was associated with a serious crime. However, the police could not gather any evidence in this case and Mukhtar Ansari could not be proven guilty. The most important of the cases registered against Mukhtar Ansari is the incident of the murder of BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai. It was 29 November 2005, which is still called a ‘Black Day’ by the people of Ghazipur. Krishnanand Rai was an MLA from Muhammadabad. Krishnanand Rai was killed and his six companions were also killed in this mayhem.Unfazed by the regime, the killers fired 400 rounds of bullets. After the incident, 67 bullets were removed from the bodies of the deceased during the postmortem. Mukhtar Ansari’s name also appeared in the contractor Ajay Prakash Singh’s murder case in Mau. The witness of this murder crime was also murdered. Similarly, the witness of the Krishnanand Rai murder case also died under suspicious circumstances. In June this year, a special MP-MLA court in Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi awarded life imprisonment to jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari in the 1991 Awadhesh Rai murder case. On August 3, 1991, Congress leader and brother of former MLA Ajay Rai, Awadhesh Rai, was shot dead outside Ajay Rai’s house in Varanasi. Ansari was presented before the court through video conference where the court convicted him under Sections 145 and 302m. In the given case, Ansari continues to be in jail and the court has declared him guilty for murder of Kapil Dev Singh. The punishment will however be announced by the court on 27th October. The maximum punishment in this case is reportedly 10 years.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

107,26-Oct-23,"Kerala: SDPI members Nauful, Yasim and Ajmal brutally attack RSS workers returning home after a Dusshera procession, arrested","The police said that all three accused who are members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) which is the political wing of the banned Popular Front of India (PFI) have a criminal history.On Thursday, October 26, the Kerala police arrested three SDPI members for allegedly attacking RSS workers. The incident took place on Sunday, October 22, while the RSS members were returning home after attending a Dusshera rally in Karunagapalliin the Kollam district of Kerala. The accused were identified as 26-year-old Naufal, a resident of Karunagapally Thazhava; 24-year-old Yasim of Kulasekharapuram Siya Mansil and 23-year-old Ajmal, a resident of the Thazhava village in Kollam, Kerala.The victims were identified as Akshay Kumar, Madhun Lal, and Kiran, all residents of the Punnamkulam town in the Thrissur district of Kerala. The police said that all three accused who are members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) which is the political wing of the banned Popular Front of India (PFI) have a criminal history.After the RSS procession on Sunday night, the RSS workers got off the bus at Puthiyakavu and were heading home when the accused Naufal, Yasim and Ajmal attacked them. Akshay Kumar suffered serious injuries in the incident and was admitted to Karunagappally Taluk Hospital. His arm was broken by the SDPI goons.Akshay and the other witnesses gave their statements to the police, based on which the police registered a case against the three accused SDPI members. Witness statements and circumstantial evidence were used to identify the accused, the police said, adding that Naufal and Ajmal are accused in several criminal cases. The police also revealed that since the accused had in the past absconded to Goa and Karnataka after committing various crimes, this time they deployed police units at various railway stations and bus stands to make sure that the accused do not get the chance to flee. Although the accused had switched off their mobile phones, the Karunagappally police team located their hiding place and apprehended them from Kayamkulam, 15 km north of Karunagapally.On 28 September 2022, the Central government banned the Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) and eight of its associates for five years under a stringent anti-terror law, accusing them of having links with global terror organisations, including ISIS. However, its political affiliate Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) was the only organisation of the radical Islamist outfit that was not banned by the Central government last year. Therefore, after being declared illegal in September of last year, the Popular Front of India (PFI) made SDPI a backyard of its erstwhile cadres to continue its operations in states like Karnataka and Kerala.It may be noted that before the central government had banned PFI, the Kerala High Court had observed that the Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) are extremist organisation indulging in serious acts of violence. The Kerala High Court further noted that both SDPI and PFI have a history of attacking members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. On November 15, 2021, a 26-year-old Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh worker Sanjith was hacked to death in front of his wife in Ellapully, Palakkad. In broad daylight, the assailants who came in a car waylaid Sanjith’s bike and attacked him in front of many people including his wife.As per reports, many of the accused in the case was linked to the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of the extremist Islamic outfit Popular Front of India (PFI).On January 24 this year, Mohammad Haroon, the key conspirator behind the case was arrested by Kerala Police. Haroon was actively involved in planning the murder along with other associates from the SDPI.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, alert sentries prevented and assailants hurled two petrol bombs inside Raj Bhavan and escaped.”Raj Bhavan was attacked today afternoon. Miscreants carrying bombs tried to barge in through the main gate. However, alert sentries prevented and assailants hurled two petrol bombs inside Raj Bhavan and escaped.@PMOIndia @HMOIndia @PIB_India @DDNewslive @ANI @PTI_NewsInitial reports had suggested that two petrol bombs were hurled but the police reportedly told PTI that only one bomb was used and “it did not create any impact the way the accused expected”. The attack damaged the barricades and some plants.A complaint has been filed at Guindy police station. Additional Commission of Chennai police Prem Anand Sinha said, “Around 3 pm, an unidentified person tried to throw some bottles of petrol outside Raj Bhavan near barricades. As soon as this was noticed by the security personnel present there, they surrounded him, confiscated other bottles from his hand and immediately handed him over to the patrol vehicle and took him to the police station.”He further said that the accused seemed drunk. “There is absolute alert and proper bandobast in front of the Raj Bhavan.” Security was heightened outside the Governor’s House following the attack.Tamil Nadu BJP Chief K Annamalai took to X, formerly Twitter, criticising the law and order situation in the DMK-ruled state. “Petrol bombs were hurled at Raj Bhavan today, reflects the true law and order situation in Tamil Nadu.

The TMMK will reportedly lay siege to Raj Bhavan seeking premature release of 49 prisoners including Muslims.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

109,26-Oct-23,"Congress leaders unhappy over invitation to PM Modi for Ram Mandir Pran Pratistha, here is how the party mocked Ram Mandir in the past, claimed ‘Ram does not exist’","Congress leader Salman Khurshid raised the question around the inauguration ceremony and asked whether the invitation was being sent to only one partyThe Congress party on Thursday (26th October), raised questions over the inauguration of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya which is scheduled to happen on 24th of January, 2024. It seemed that the party desperately wanted to be part of the event as it questioned why only BJP and PM Modi were extended the invitation to the inauguration. Congress leader Salman Khurshid raised the question around the inauguration ceremony and asked whether the invitation was being sent to only one party. “Is this becoming a party event now? God belongs to everyone. Every party should have received the invitation. They should have at least made it clear that everyone will be invited. I have not come across any such statement,” the Congress leader was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, Congress leader from Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath said that he was happy that the Ram Mandir is being built but expressed unhappiness over PM Modi being invited by the temple trust for the event. “Does the Ram Mandir belong to the BJP? It belongs to everyone in our country. It is a very big symbol of our Sanatana Dharma. I am very happy that the Ram Mandir is finally being built,” he said. This is after the Shri Ram Janambhoomi Trust invited Prime Minister Modi on 25th October to inaugurate the temple and establish Lord Ram’s idol in the Garbhagriha of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22, 2024. PM Modi also welcomed the invitation and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to witness such a historic event.जय सियाराम!आज का दिन बहुत भावनाओं से भरा हुआ है। अभी श्रीराम जन्मभूमि तीर्थ क्षेत्र ट्रस्ट के पदाधिकारी मुझसे मेरे निवास स्थान पर मिलने आए थे। उन्होंने मुझे श्रीराम मंदिर में प्राण-प्रतिष्ठा के अवसर पर अयोध्या आने के लिए निमंत्रित किया है। मैं खुद को बहुत धन्य महसूस कर रहा… pic.twitter.com/rc801AraInWhile the Congress leaders accused the BJP of allegedly politicizing the construction and inauguration of Ram Mandir ahead of the 2024 General Elections, it seemed that the leaders desperately wanted to be part of the event. The leaders expressed happiness over the inauguration ceremony of the Hindu temple and also ‘lauded’ the Sanatan Dharma ahead of the elections. The Congress has always played safe when things have revolved around the Ram Mandir. They made all the attempts to please the Hindus and the Islamists but ended up standing by the Islamists for the votes. Some of the Congress leaders expressed happiness over the Ram Mandir while maximum of the party leaders have criticized the construction of the Ram Mandir in favor of the Islamists in the past. It is to be recalled how Congress leaders and its allies have refused to believe in the existence of Lord Rama and mocked the construction of the Ram temple. Recently, DMK leader TKS Elangovan described Lord Rama’s birth as ‘mythology’ and alleged that the BJP was trying to replace history with mythology. “They have demolished history and replaced it with mythology. Any country should be proud of its history, it should know the history. Ram’s birth is mythology, it is a story from Ramayana. It is literature. They want to replace history with mythology. That is what the BJP is trying to do. With these people in power, what can we expect?… He wants to make use of it as a political tool. He is not interested in Ram. BJP does not consider Ram as an important thing but their political gain becomes important so they are making use of Ram for their political gains,” the leader was quoted as saying. Also, in June 2023, Rahul Gandhi’s ‘mentor’ Sam Pitroda mocked the Hindu deities while accusing the BJP of focusing only on religious matters. “We have a problem with unemployment, inflation, education, health. No one talks about these things. But everyone talks about Ram, Hanuman, mandir,” he had said during an event hosted by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. The video of the incident had massively gone viral over the internet then. Sam Pitroda insulting Ram Mandir and Hinduism at Rahul Gandhi's US event.Rahul kept silent. pic.twitter.com/uw7QwZWEUpFurther, Kapil Sibal who was earlier a member of Congress had appeared for the Sunni Waqf Board and Babri Masjid Action Committee in the Supreme Court to term the case as a ‘trap’ laid by the BJP. “This judgment is going to have huge political ramifications. A party is pushing its manifesto. The court should not fall into a trap. This is nothing but a trap,” he had said in the year 2017. Sibal was then slammed by the netizens for the choice of his clients and the stance taken by him.Sibal had been accusing the BJP of using the Ram Mandir issue for its political gains. He recently reiterated his stance saying that ‘no one becomes Ram by building Ram Mandir. People must learn to walk on the path of Ram.” To the BJPHow many times will you use Lord Ram for political gain ?Why don’t you embrace the virtues of Lord Ram :His : valor, chivalry, loyalty, compassion, love, obedience, courage, and equipoiseYour governance does not display any of these virtues !In the year 2018, Congress leader P Chidambaram mocked the idea of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and said that BJP was only focusing on building temples and giant statues. “At the beginning of five years, the promise is for Development, Jobs, and Money in every citizen’s bank account. Nothing was achieved, but at the end of five years, the new promise was for grand temples, giant statues, and doles,” he was quoted as saying. The BJP then slammed the leader for playing with the sentiments of Hindus. As if denying the reality of Lord Ram wasn’t enough, the grand old party of India in 2022 came up with fresh ways to ridicule Hinduism. The leaders compared Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to Lord Rama as the former embarked on his political stunt called ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’.It's a coincidence that Rahul Gandhi, Lord Ram's names begin with R: Congress' Nana PatoleRead @ANI Story | https://t.co/sGuyRWOIJd#Nanapatole #RahulGandhi #Congress pic.twitter.com/COK07YMFjLMaharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole in a statement compared Congress senior leader Rahul Gandhi to the Hindu Lord Ram saying that it is a coincidence that the names of both begin with “R”. “Even Lord Sri Ram walked (PadaYatra) from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and even Shankaracharya walked the same way, and so is Rahul Gandhi doing in the form of padayatra,” Patole added.Nana Patole’s remark came after Rajasthan Minister Parsadi Lal Meena said that Rahul Gandhi walked more than Lord Ram walked from Ayodhya to Sri Lanka. “Rahul Gandhi’s padayatra will be historic. Lord Ram too had gone from Ayodhya to Sri Lanka on foot. Rahul Gandhi is walking even more than that, from Kanyakumari to Kashmir,” Meena had said.#WATCH | Dausa: Rajasthan Minister Parsadi Lal Meena says, ""Rahul Gandhi's padayatra will be historic. Lord Ram too had gone from Ayodhya to Sri Lanka on foot. Rahul Gandhi is walking even more than that, from Kanniyakumari to Kashmir…."" (17.10.2022) pic.twitter.com/LPswB0Wh8eFurther, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) President K Sudhakaran also ridiculed Bhagwan Sri Ram, Sri Lakshman, and Sita Mata by distorting Ramayana. He stated in a recent video interview with The New Indian Express (TNIE) that while returning from Lanka on the Pushpaka Vimanam, after defeating Ravana, Lakshman briefly entertained the thought of pushing his brother, Lord Ram, into the sea and go away with his wife Sita.K Sudhakaran made these bizarre comments while stating that there are significant distinctions between lawmakers from Kerala’s northern and southern regions.In 2020, ahead of Ayodhya Ram Mandir Bhoomi Pujan on August 5, Zee News conducted a discussion on Ayodhya and Ram Mandir. In a shocking display of ignorance, Congress leader Kumar Ketkar denied the historical existence of Shri Ram and cast aspersions about the Hindu God being a creation of literature.In September 2007, the Central government run by Congress-led UPA 1 had said that there is no historical proof of Lord Ram’s existence.An affidavit filed by the Congress-led government read, “Valmiki Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas admittedly form an important part of ancient Indian literature, but these cannot be said to be historical records to incontrovertibly prove the existence of the characters and occurrences of events depicted therein.” The affidavit was filed to register the UPA government’s opposition to the demand to scrap the Sethusamudram project as it would damage the Ram Setu.Senior Congress leader of the time, Kapil Sibal fought the Ram Janmabhoomi case for the Sunni Waqf Board opposing the building of a magnificent Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya. He also employed dilatory tactics and asked the apex court to delay the decision in the Ram Janmabhoomi case till the 2019 elections.  Another eminent Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had earlier claimed that no ‘good Hindu’ would want a Ram Mandir at Babri site. Tharoor urged that one should have the Ram Mandir in one’s heart. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Adding to the distress of liberals and seculars, the invitation won’t be limited to Delhi’s bungalow number 7 on Lok Kalyan Marg (the official residence of the Prime Minister) but will extend to households in 5 lakh villages nationwide.Kameshwar Chaupal, a member of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, informed OpIndia that the Ram temple’s inauguration rituals commence on 16th January 2024, in Ayodhya. The Pran-Pratishtha rituals are scheduled for 22nd January 2024. During this time, about 5 thousand saints and sages and about 5 thousand people who have done remarkable work in different fields like art, and education will also be present. The celebrations will continue for 2 more days after Pran-PratishthaAccording to Chaupal, the invitation for the Pran-Pratishtha will reach 5 lakh villages across the country. People are invited to Ayodhya from 50 key centres in November. These individuals will carry ‘Akshat’ from Ayodhya to these centres. The Akshat will then be distributed to the 5 lakh villages from these centres as an invitation for the Pran-Pratishtha. On 22nd January, people in these villages will gather at their local temples to witness the live broadcast of the Pran-Pratishtha ceremony together.Kameshwar Chaupal, who was a member of the Bihar Legislative Council, is also the provincial president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (South Bihar). He laid the first brick of the foundation of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya on 9 November 1989. After the Supreme Court’s decision in 2019, when the trust was formed for the construction of the temple at Ramjanmabhoomi, he was also given a place in it.On 25th October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi received an invitation from the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra Trust to participate in the Pran-Pratishtha of Lord Shri Ram Lalla at the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple. The Prime Minister shared this information on X through a post. He wrote, “Hail Siya Ram! Today is a day full of emotions. Recently the officials of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust had come to meet me at my residence. He has invited me to come to Ayodhya on the occasion of the consecration of the Shri Ram temple. I feel very blessed. It is my good fortune that in my lifetime, I will witness this historic occasion.”जय सियाराम!आज का दिन बहुत भावनाओं से भरा हुआ है। अभी श्रीराम जन्मभूमि तीर्थ क्षेत्र ट्रस्ट के पदाधिकारी मुझसे मेरे निवास स्थान पर मिलने आए थे। उन्होंने मुझे श्रीराम मंदिर में प्राण-प्रतिष्ठा के अवसर पर अयोध्या आने के लिए निमंत्रित किया है। मैं खुद को बहुत धन्य महसूस कर रहा… pic.twitter.com/rc801AraInKameshwar Chaupal explained that according to Hindu tradition, housewarming is best done during an auspicious period. Hindus have struggled for centuries for the Ram Temple. Due to the auspicious timing on 22nd January 2024, it has been chosen for the Pran-Pratishtha in the sanctum sanctorum of the newly constructed Ram Temple.It is noteworthy that Lord Shri Ram was born during the Abhijit Yoga. Compared to other dates, this auspicious Yoga will remain for an extended period on 22nd January 2024. This is the reason why this date has been deemed most suitable for the Pran-Pratishtha.Abhijit Yoga occurs daily, although its duration varies. Sometimes it lasts only for a moment, while at other times, it extends for a considerable period. It is considered the most auspicious or highly favourable moment of the day. It is believed that commencing any task during this Yoga increases the likelihood of its success.Kameshwar Chaupal informed OpIndia that from 25th January 2024, the general public will be able to visit the majestic Ram Temple to witness the deity’s presence and get the holy Darshan of Lord Ram. However, the decision regarding which idol will be consecrated in the sanctum sanctorum has not been made yet. Three different idols are being crafted. Similarly, the final decision on who will oversee the Pran-Pratishtha and the decision regarding who will be the patron sages holding the rituals is still pending.According to Chaupal, individuals who participated in the movement for the Ram Janmabhoomi temple from 1984 to the Supreme Court’s 2019 ruling will receive a special darshan at the temple. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust will extend invitations to karsevaks from various regions, granting them the opportunity to witness the deity. As part of this initiative, karsevaks from Nepal and North Bihar will have darshan on 2nd February 2024, while those from South Bihar and Jharkhand will have their turn on 3rd February 2024.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

112,26-Oct-23,Social media platform X introduces audio and video calling feature: Here’s how it will work,"It's still unclear how extensively the platform has made audio and video calls available or if it's only offered to Premium subscribersThe social media giant X, which was originally known as Twitter, have made massive changes since billionaire Elon Musk took over a year ago. Now, a new feature which allows users to make audio and video conversations with others through X was unveiled on 25 October. The application’s settings now include a new “Enable audio and video calling” toggle which permits the user to turn the function on and then select who they are comfortable using it with. It also provides a plethora of customisation options that make it possible for individuals to select from whom they accept calls.One can choose to accept audio and video calls from verified users, people they follow, and those in their address book or from all three. A person can initiate a call by opening a direct message with another one by clicking the phone symbol located in the upper right corner of the screen and selecting between an audio or video call.Early version of video & audio calling on 𝕏 https://t.co/aFI3VujLMhThe call icon appears in the upper right corner of the screen when one is conversing with someone else on the app just like it does with Instagram and WhatsApp.ring ring pic.twitter.com/1WemXRhFZfX didn’t formally announce the feature’s introduction, however, the official account seemed to hint at it moments before it started to surface with a mysterious message.ready for it…?Elon Musk, the chairman and CTO (Chief Technology Officer) has long expressed his intention to turn the platform into an “everything app” which includes the addition of voice and video interactions. He recently declared that “no phone number needed” access to the functionality would be possible on PC, Mac, iOS and Android devices.The audio and video calling feature will mean that Twitter will now directly compete with WhatsApp of Meta and Facetime of Apple in the sector.Video & audio calls coming to X:– Works on iOS, Android, Mac & PC– No phone number needed– X is the effective global address book That set of factors is unique.It’s still unclear how extensively the platform has made audio and video calls available or if it’s only offered to Premium subscribers. Creator of the hashtag and supporter of open-source software Chris Messina discovered last month that X’s coding implied users would need to join up for X’s Premium membership in order to take advantage of the function.The CEO of the business, Linda Yaccarino announced earlier in August that native calling services would soon be available to social network users. This would permit users to make audio or video conversations without disclosing their phone numbers. She stated that the option is going to be accessible through the “Direct Message” (DM) menu and that the platform would put in place certain safeguards to prevent users from receiving unsolicited calls.Adding these new services is a big move for X to help draw in more users and boost the microblogging platform’s engagement rate, especially since other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram already have audio and video calling capabilities.Additionally, Elon Musk proclaimed that all users would have to pay an annual fee to access the platform with customers in the Philippines and New Zealand already having to pay $1 for one year. He has already modified the features of the social networking site several times since he acquired it. He pronounced during the summer that users would no longer be able to block accounts on the platform. Moreover, he developed the premium Blue membership plan which confined access to the feature previously known as Tweetdeck to Blue customers only.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
