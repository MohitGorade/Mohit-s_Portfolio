 I've recently crafted a compelling HR Attrition Analysis dashboard, showcasing my proficiency in dissecting workforce dynamics. The dashboard, developed with keen attention to detail, captures the essence of employee turnover within the company, presenting crucial insights such as a 16.1% attrition rate, demographic compositions, and key patterns influencing departures. This project not only demonstrates my ability to translate complex HR data into actionable insights but also underscores my commitment to contributing valuable analytical solutions to real-world business challenges.
