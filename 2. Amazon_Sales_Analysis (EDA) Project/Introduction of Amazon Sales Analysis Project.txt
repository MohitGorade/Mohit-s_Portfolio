As a data analysis student, my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on dissecting Amazon sales data to uncover insights into consumer behavior and market trends. Through the exploration of various variables, patterns emerged, shedding light on product preferences, pricing dynamics, and sales patterns. This comprehensive analysis not only deepened my understanding of real-world data but also equipped me with valuable skills in interpreting and communicating actionable insights. The project lays the groundwork for future endeavors, demonstrating my proficiency in leveraging data to extract meaningful information and contribute to informed decision-making in the realm of e-commerce analytics.
